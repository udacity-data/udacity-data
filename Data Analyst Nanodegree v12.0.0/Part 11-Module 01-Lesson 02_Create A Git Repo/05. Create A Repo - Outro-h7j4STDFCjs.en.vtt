00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
In this lesson, we use git init to create our own repository.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.050
We used git clone to copy an existing repository,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.179
and we used git status to determine the status of a repository.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.548
Now, you might want to just jump right into making commits

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.449
because a repository isn't very useful without them.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.869
But before we start,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.914
being able to review commits will help immensely when we start making our own.

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:26.710
So, let's learn how to review existing commits.
