00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.365
In the last lesson we looked at some of the common terms used in version control systems.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:07.650
You also install GIT on your computer and did

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.220
some initial configuration of GIT like adding your name and email.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.260
If you skip these steps it's probably

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.320
a good idea to go back and check them out again before continuing.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.605
In this lesson we'll be learning how to create our own GIT repositories.

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:23.629
I mean we can't really do anything without having a repo to work with.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.934
Oh and "repo" is just short for repository,

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:28.588
does mean exactly the same thing,

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:30.809
so I'll be using them interchangeably.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.920
Remember to keep the list of terms nearby as a reference.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.829
We'll be looking at three GIT commands in this lesson.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.140
GIT init, GIT clone and GIT status.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.615
With GIT init, you'll create brand new repositories from scratch on your computer.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.789
With GIT clone, you'll clone or copy

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.254
an existing repo from somewhere else to your local computer.

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:56.335
You'll also learn how vitally important it is to know the status of a repo.

00:00:56.335 --> 00:01:00.570
You'll learn to check the status of a repo with the GIT status command.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.670
Three simple commands but they're starting us

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.310
on our journey towards version control mastery.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's get going with GIT init.
