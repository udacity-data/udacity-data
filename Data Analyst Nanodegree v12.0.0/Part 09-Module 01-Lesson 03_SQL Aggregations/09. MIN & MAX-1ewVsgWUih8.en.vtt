00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
The syntax for min and max is similar to SUM and COUNT.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.885
It shouldn't be surprising that the minimum for each paper type is zero.

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:12.800
Some customers only order one or two types of paper.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.515
What is surprising is that the largest single order is for poster paper,

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.219
despite the fact that it's the least popular overall.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.114
There are important implications here.

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:24.479
Even though it's not the most popular item,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.185
Parch &amp; Posey may want to produce enough poster paper

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:30.000
to be able to fulfill pretty big orders at any given time.
