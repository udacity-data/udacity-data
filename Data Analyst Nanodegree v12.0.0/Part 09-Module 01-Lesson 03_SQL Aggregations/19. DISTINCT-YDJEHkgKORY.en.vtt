00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
You can think of DISTINCT this way,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.280
if you want to group by some columns but you don't

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.830
necessarily want to include any aggregations,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.085
you can use DISTINCT instead.

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:13.170
As an example, let's revisit the count of events by

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.664
channel by account we looked at in the GROUP BY segment.

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:20.488
Notice the row count, 1509.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.574
If we get rid of the events column,

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:25.559
you can see that the resulting query returns basically the same

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.969
results with the same row count.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.320
And if we run that query again with DISTINCT,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.204
you can see that the results are the same.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:42.987
Of course, they don't include the COUNT

00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:46.009
anymore because we've removed it from our select statement.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.649
Since it's no longer in our select statement,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.019
and since we're no longer doing an aggregation,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.000
we don't need the GROUP BY clause either.
