00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
So now we know which paper types are most popular and we have

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.089
a sense of the largest order size we might need to fulfill at any given time.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.300
But what's the average order size?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000
What can we expect to see on a regular basis?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.245
We'll use the average function which is typed as

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:19.339
AVG and has a similar syntax to all of the other aggregation functions.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.184
So it looks like that large poster paper order must have been a major outlier

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:25.179
because the average poster order is only

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.774
about a third the size of the average standard order.

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:30.039
When you're using the average function,

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.850
keep in mind that it can only be used on numerical columns.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.085
Also, it ignores nulls completely,

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:38.829
meaning that rows with null values are not counted in

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.284
the numerator or the denominator when calculating the average.

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:44.169
If you want to treat nulls as zero,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.030
you'll need to take a sum and divide it by

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.000
the count rather than just using the average function.
