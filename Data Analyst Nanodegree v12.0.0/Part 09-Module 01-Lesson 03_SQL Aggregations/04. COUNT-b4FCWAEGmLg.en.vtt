00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.298
Here's a list of orders in the last month,

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:05.129
assuming it's currently January 2017.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.185
I'm using mode to run these queries,

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:11.024
which tells me that there are 463 rows in my result set.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.609
Still, you'll need to learn to count in SQL,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.230
because you can use it to count in

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.304
a much more fine-grained way than simply counting all the rows in a result set.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.629
We can do this by modifying our SELECT statement to use a COUNT function.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.009
You can see that this returns a single row of output in a single column,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.320
and the value is exactly the same as the row count we saw before.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.115
Let's give that column an alias,

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:38.715
so that it's a little easier to read.

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:43.495
Okay, much better. So, how does this work?

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:50.344
The COUNT function is returning a count of all the rows that contain some non-null data.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:53.810
It's very unusual to have a row that is entirely null.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.160
So, the result produced by a

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.299
COUNT(*) is typically equal to the number of rows in the table.
