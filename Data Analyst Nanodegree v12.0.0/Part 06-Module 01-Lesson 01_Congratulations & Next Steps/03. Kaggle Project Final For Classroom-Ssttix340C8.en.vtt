00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
So, with Kaggle, you can actually set up your own competitions?

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:04.080
Yes. Absolutely.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.200
We're going to set up a competition for students to be able to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.544
share their work through Kaggle and just get them onto the Kaggle platform.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.269
How can they go about doing that?

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.799
How easy is that process?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.230
How easy is it to get integrated into the community?

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.870
Yeah. I'm going to, answer it backwards.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.260
So, getting integrated into the community, pretty straightforward.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.330
People are fairly welcoming.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.149
You can just write your Kernel,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.070
make it public, and post on the forums,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.170
you know, can I get some feedback? What do you guys think?

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.195
Here's my approach to this problem, what would you do?

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:35.750
And people tend to be pretty responsive and interested,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.810
because it's a large community and people are really excited about data science.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.530
Do you know how large the community is?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.045
We definitely have over a million registered users.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:44.645
Okay.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:45.455
Yeah.

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:47.539
That great. I mean that's a huge community.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.884
Yeah. No, it is. And it feels vibrant.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:50.640
Yeah.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.000
We also have something called In-class.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.515
Which is a way that you can set up your own competitions.

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:58.365
So, you would pick a data set,

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:00.980
and then you split it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.559
into testing and training just like you would. So, no one would see.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.240
So, testing and training for people to see,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.454
and then a third validation set that nobody would see. So, it would be hidden.

00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:12.125
And then you would give people access to it and they would train their models,

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:18.519
and then upload their answer file for the, you know, the-

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.099
What they think should happen. Yeah. Right.

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:23.729
Yeah exactly. Then you'd validate it against the specific,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.260
the secret, validation data set

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.329
and then ranking based on whatever sort of metric you're using.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.409
So, if you were just looking at,

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:34.909
you probably wouldn't use like raw percent correct.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.079
You could if you wanted to, right.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.250
If it was sort of a problem that made sense there.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.650
But I've seen people use these for obviously,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.555
In-class, hence the name.

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:47.330
But also, if you just like, when you do a hackathon or just a project for some friends,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.935
or like a little friendly competition.

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:50.640
Yeah, cool.
