00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.605
Every industry is looking for smart solutions to real world problems using data science,

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.840
which is why Udacity collaborated with

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.190
top companies to create the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.175
Data science is usually important to IBM.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.395
These are the skills that we need now.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.930
To me, the most exciting collaboration is between

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.430
people who have deep experience and deep intuition about an industry,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.565
and then being able to enrich that intuition with data.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:34.310
I think that is really where you hit

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.585
the sweet spot for the best kind of business decision-making.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:41.780
The biggest thing that I'm trying to achieve every day,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.345
is to make sure that the technologies we use in data science are available to everybody.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.240
In this program, you'll build a portfolio of projects,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.360
focused on real challenges crafted with industry input.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.580
I'm really excited that the project that Udacity and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.810
Figure8 are doing together is focused on disaster response.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.110
That's going to help us have a positive impact

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.360
in the world as we respond to future disasters.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.365
This portfolio can get you connected to valuable new job opportunities.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:10.730
It is a wonderful opportunity,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.655
because the people like are and just enjoy the learning,

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.155
want to sort of level off,

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.765
and then also have an impact.

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:20.150
Well, I think that the most important skill in a data scientist is

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.520
curiosity and the ability to go and find

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.295
your own answers when they're not immediately evident.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:29.030
I think that people who come in with the Udacity training are already really

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.770
demonstrating that because you're unafraid to go and teach yourself something new.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.250
Take the leap forward with Udacity in collaboration with industry leaders.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.380
Take your career to the next level.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.150
There's no better time than now.
