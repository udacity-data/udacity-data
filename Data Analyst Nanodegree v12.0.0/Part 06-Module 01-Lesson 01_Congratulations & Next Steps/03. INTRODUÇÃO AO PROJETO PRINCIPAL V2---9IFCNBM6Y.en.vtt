00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
In the next few years, software developers will need to know how to

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.589
incorporate deep learning models into everyday applications.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.960
Anything with a camera will be using an image classification,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.910
object detection, and face recognition,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.164
and so on, all based on deep learning models.

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.549
For is user interfaces like Alexa, Cortana,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.390
and Google Assistant all powered by

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.949
speech recognition models will become more and more common.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.829
So, in this project,

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.869
you'll be implementing an image classification application.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.039
This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images,

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.174
then use the trained model to classify images.

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:38.399
First, you'll develop your code in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.509
a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.109
Then, you'll convert the code to

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.420
a Python application that runs from the command line. Good luck.
