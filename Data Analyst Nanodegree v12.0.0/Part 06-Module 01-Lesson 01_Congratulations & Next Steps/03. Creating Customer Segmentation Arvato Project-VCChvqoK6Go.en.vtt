00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.194
So, I'm here with Timo from Arvato,

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:06.719
and we're actually teaming up together to do a project.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.339
So, the unsupervised learning project that we're working on in this lesson,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.939
actually throughout the last few lessons,

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:21.704
are all aimed at strategies to cluster data together and group data in different ways.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.399
The Arvato data that we're working with,

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.529
can you talk a little bit about what it's used

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.750
for and what are the features in the data that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.960
maybe you find matter the most for the business goals that you have for the company.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.375
Sure. So, yes.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:41.329
You'll have one dataset that is a Bertelsmann Arvato proprietary database.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.664
It includes demographic information,

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:48.469
some 100 attributes about people in Germany.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.719
We gather this data from various public sources in Germany.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.989
Then we also provide the second dataset to you that actually includes

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.230
demographic information attributes of the customers of one of our clients.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.760
What we're asking you to do in this project is,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.989
to analyze the attributes of the existing clients,

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:18.625
and match them to the database with people in Germany.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.700
I think another challenge in your project,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.525
is you'll see this huge amount of variables of attributes,

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:30.715
and of course it makes sense to cluster them in a smart way.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:32.790
That's a day to day job.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460
That's something we're doing everyday.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.314
So, there's financial and demographic information

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:40.319
about all of these different individuals?

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.879
Yes.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:45.119
So, one of the things that students will likely want to do is try to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.410
figure out what things are related to one another within the dataset.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.390
Also, there's just messiness that comes with working with any data.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.120
If you're pulling from public sources sometimes things might not be entered correctly.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.680
Is that true for some of this potentially?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.440
It's totally true. Even when you get public data,

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.030
data is always messy and always needs to be cleaned.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.288
You always need to spend a fair amount of time to actually understand,

00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:15.309
what does the data essentially say.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.640
We are seeing that in these contexts where we're working directly with the client.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:28.509
Where we think it should be clean data, it's messy.

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.549
Timo, thanks so much for some insight on the dataset.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.675
Thank you. Thank you and thank you students for participating in this project.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:38.285
It's a real-life project.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:41.770
It's real data. So, good luck.
