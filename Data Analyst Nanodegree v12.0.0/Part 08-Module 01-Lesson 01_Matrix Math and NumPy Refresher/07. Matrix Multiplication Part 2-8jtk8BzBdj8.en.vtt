00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.435
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:03.589
In the last video, I showed
you these two matrices.

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.179
And I mentioned that we can't
calculate their matrix product.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:08.759
Now that you know how
matrix multiplication works,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.279
it's easier to see why we can't.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:12.929
Remember, we were
finding a series

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.269
of dot products between
the rows of the left matrix

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.789
and the columns of the right.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.539
And what do we need
to find a dot product?

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.269
We need two vectors that
are the same length.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.339
That means the rows
of the first matrix

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.109
need to be the same
length as the columns

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.309
of the second matrix.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:27.619
And what's the length of a row?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.833
Its number of columns.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.250
And what's the
length of a column?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.620
Its number of rows.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.780
So that gives us a
very important rule

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.310
for matrix multiplication.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.890
The number of columns
in the left matrix

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.484
must equal the number
of rows in the matrix.

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:43.859
You can see it easily when
you write out their shape side

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:44.609
by side.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.067
Remember, we always specify the
dimensions as rows by columns.

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:50.399
So when you put them next to
each other in the order you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.990
plan to multiply
them, the number

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.420
of columns for the left
matrix ends up here

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.000
on the inside next to the
number of rows for the right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.530
matrix here.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.539
If you want to
multiply two matrices,

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.090
these two inner dimensions
need to be the same size.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.469
So we could find the product of
this 2 by 3 matrix times this 3

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.319
by 2 matrix, because these
two 3's are the same.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.289
Or we could find the product of
this 3 by 2 matrix and this 2

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.200
by 3 matrix, because these
two 2's are the same.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.359
And it might take us a
while, but we could even

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.780
find the product of a
10,000 by 300 matrix and 300

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.390
by 6,000 matrix, because
these two 300's are the same.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.049
Just remember, when you look
at their shapes side by side,

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.879
no matter what these
outer numbers are,

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:31.709
you can always
multiply two matrices

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.671
if these numbers on the
inside are the same.

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:36.629
And by the way, if those
numbers are different,

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.170
like they were in our original
example, where we would end up

00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:40.824
with a 3 and the
2 in the middle,

00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:42.239
then you just can't
multiply them.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:43.689
It doesn't work.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.959
Now, let's take a look
at these two examples.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.969
In both cases, their
inner dimensions match.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.379
So we can multiply them.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:51.689
Notice how the numbers in
both of these left matrices

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.605
are actually the same.

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:55.019
They're just arranged
into a different shape, 2

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:58.500
by 3 versus 3 by 2, and likewise
for the matrices on the right.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.060
But these slight
changes in shape

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.980
have a big effect on
the actual results

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.660
of these multiplications.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.369
Not only are the
numbers in the answers

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.439
different, the sizes of
the answers are different.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.800
We get a 2 by 2 matrix
in one case, and a 3

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.963
by 3 in the other.

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:13.379
This brings us to
our second point

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.329
about matrix multiplication.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.700
The answer matrix always
has the same number

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.459
of rows as the left
matrix and the same number

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.514
of columns as the right matrix.

00:02:22.514 --> 00:02:24.930
Again, you can see it easily
when you read out their shape

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.269
side by side.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.810
This time, we're
looking at these two

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.310
numbers on the outside.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
The first one is the number
of rows for the first matrix.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.170
And the last one is
the number of columns

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.540
for the second matrix.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.039
These define the shape of the
answer in the same order, rows

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.239
by columns.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.170
So multiplying this 2 by 3
matrix by this 3 by 2 matrix

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.269
gives you this 2 by 2 matrix.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.420
And multiplying these matrices,
that are 3 by 2 and 2 by 3,

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.669
gives you this 3 by 3 matrix.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.379
And multiplying a 10,000 by 300
matrix by a 300 by 6,000 matrix

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.669
would give you a
10,000 by 6,000 matrix.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.699
I want to take a look
at one more example.

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.669
Here, we want to multiply
these two matrices.

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.519
We can see from these
3's and their shapes

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.350
that it's safe to multiply them.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.989
And these outer dimensions tell
us we'll get a 2 by 2 matrix

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.900
as a result. In fact, we'll
get this 2 by 2 matrix.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.200
Now, let's take those
same two matrices,

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.899
but swap their order
in the multiplication.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.469
When we look at their shapes in
this order, we get 3 by 2 and 2

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.490
by 3.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.040
Those inner 2's tell us that
we can safely multiply them

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.269
in this order as well.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.820
But the outer dimensions tell
us the result will be a 3

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.180
by 3 matrix.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.243
Calculating the product
gives us this result.

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:36.159
This brings us to our
third point about matrix

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.530
multiplication, order matters.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.620
If you have two matrices, A
and B, then the product AB

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.349
is not the same
as the product BA.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.688
Standard multiplication
is commutative,

00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:48.729
which means you can change
the order of the items

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.769
in the multiplication,
and you'll still

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.120
get the same answer, 2 times
5 and 5 times 2 both equal 10.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.400
But as you just saw,
matrix multiplication

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.230
is definitely not commutative.

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.329
Sometimes the sizes will only
line up one way or the other.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.870
For example, a 4 by
2 matrix and 3 by 4

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.719
matrix can only be
multiplied in one order.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.180
This way it works, but
this way it doesn't.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.909
Other times, like in
the previous example,

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.039
you can multiply
them in either order,

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.528
but you'll get
different results.

00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:18.069
And just to make
sure you don't think

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:20.560
it's only related to the
size, consider these two

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.088
square matrices.

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:25.281
Multiplying them in either order
produces the same sized result.

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:27.280
But notice how the values
in each of the answers

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.275
are different.

00:04:28.276 --> 00:04:29.650
This leads me to
the last point I

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:31.358
want to make about
matrix multiplication.

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:32.815
It's actually
something I mentioned

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:33.939
in the previous video.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.769
Whenever you multiply
two matrices,

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.500
you're actually dealing with
the rows of the first matrix

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.689
and the columns of
the second matrix.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.329
But now, it should be easier
to see why that's important.

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.149
If you're not careful,
your dot products

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:46.666
might combine the
wrong elements,

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:48.250
which would give you
the wrong answer,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.829
even if the multiplication
looks like it works.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.060
I'll go into that some
more in the next video.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.879
So remember, when you
build your matrices,

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.009
organize your data
into rows or columns,

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.620
and then be sure to line up
all your math appropriately.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.483
By the way, I know
this was a long video.

00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:02.899
So I've listed out
the main points

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.060
you need to remember about
matrix multiplication,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.920
and included those in
the class notes below.
