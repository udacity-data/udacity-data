00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.990
Earlier, we talked
about element-wise matrix

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.730
operations.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.480
And that actually
covers a lot of the math

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.730
involved with neural networks.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.859
But when it comes
to multiplication,

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.199
things can get a little
more complicated.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.379
Here, we're multiplying a matrix
by itself to square its values.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.719
If you look at the answer,
it's fairly obvious

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:21.049
where each value comes
from, 1 times 1 equals 1,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.300
2 times 2 equals 4, 3 times
3 equals 9, and so on.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.560
This element-wise multiplication
is valid operation.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.619
But most of the time when people
mention matrix multiplication,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.390
this isn't what they mean.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.850
Instead, they're usually talking
about a special operation

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.450
called the matrix product,
which ends up looking like this.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.300
Now when you look at the answer,
it's probably not so clear

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.289
where these numbers
are coming from.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.449
Here's another difference.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.359
We said element-wise
matrix math required

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.009
matrices of the same size.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.549
For example, this element-wise
multiplication works fine.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.979
But if you tried to find the
matrix product of those same

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.140
matrices, well, you can't.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.195
It can be confusing.

00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:59.570
And you're pretty
much guaranteed

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.950
to mess it up at
least a few times

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.540
when you start building
neural networks.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.829
But this is actually one of
the most common operations

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.209
you'll use, so it's
important to understand.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:09.019
OK, so how do we
actually calculate

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:10.939
the product of two matrices?

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.620
Well, before we
deal with matrices,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.650
let's start with just
two equal length vectors.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.690
One operation we can
perform on these vector

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.466
is called a dot product.

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.049
For this class, you
won't need to know

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.701
how dot products are used.

00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:25.159
But there's the link below the
video, if you're interested.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.810
To find the dot
product, we first

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.060
multiply the corresponding
elements of each vector.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.230
So the 0 times the 1, the
2 times the 7, and so on.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.740
Then, we add up all those
results to get a single number,

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.780
in this case, 180.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.109
This operation basically let's us
take two vectors of any length,

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.329
as long as they're equal,
and convert those vectors

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.870
into a single number.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.439
So how does that help us
multiply two matrices?

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.200
It turns out, to find the
product of two matrices,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.019
we take a series of
products between every row

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:57.719
in the left matrix and
every column in the matrix.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.439
That's really
important to remember.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.590
Whenever you multiply
two matrices,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.290
you're actually dealing with
the rows of the first matrix

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.540
and the columns of
the second matrix.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.419
I'll go into more detail about
why that's important later.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.730
But for now, let's work
through an example.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.209
To find the product
of these matrices,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.840
we'll start by taking
the dot product

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.819
of the first row
of the left matrix

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.909
and the first column
of the right matrix.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.349
For now, just ignore
all these other numbers,

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.689
then we can pretend this
row and this column are just

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.849
two equal length vectors.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.789
Now, we find their dot product,
with corresponding elements

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.159
moving across this row
and down this column.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.939
So just like before, we
have the 0 times the 1,

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.189
the 2 times the 7, and so on.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.229
The product between
this row and this column

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.229
becomes one entry in
the result matrix.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.780
You put it at the same
row and column and indices

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.300
as the row and column you
just used to calculate it.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.090
So since we used row 1 in
the left matrix and column 1

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.810
in the right, the answer
goes here in row 1 column 1

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.310
of the new matrix.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.189
If we had instead used row 2
in the left matrix and column 3

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.270
in the right, the answer would
end up here in row 2 column 3.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.370
OK, all that work
was just to find

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.331
one element in the new matrix.

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.539
To get the whole result, we
need to find dot products

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.669
for every row in
this matrix combined

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.435
with every column in this one.

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:15.310
There are three columns
in the second matrix.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.159
So that means we need
three dot products

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.439
for each row in
the first matrix.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.659
And since there are two
rows in the first matrix,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.990
that means we'll need to
find a total of six dot

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.670
products for this one
matrix multiplication.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:27.623
We have one.

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:29.039
So to find the
other five, we just

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.679
repeat the process for
each row column pair.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.379
So the product between
row 1 and column 2

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.659
becomes the entry
at row 1 column 2.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.969
Then, we finish off this row
by finding the dot product

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.875
between row 1 and column 3.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.750
We do the same thing
for the next row finding

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.310
dot products for row 2 column
1, row 2 column 2, and row 2

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.162
column 3.

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:49.620
With all that done,
we finally have

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.245
the result of the
matrix multiplication

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:52.330
we actually wanted.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.760
That was quite a bit of work.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.679
The answer matrix only
has six numbers in it.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.120
But to find those
six numbers, we

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.080
did 24 multiplications
and 18 additions.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.542
As your matrices grow,
it gets even worse.

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.750
I guess that's why we do
stuff with computers, right?

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.819
I mentioned earlier
how there are

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.294
times when taking the product
of two matrices won't work.

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:10.169
In the next video, I'll
talk more about that,

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.454
and give you some important tips
about matrix multiplication.
