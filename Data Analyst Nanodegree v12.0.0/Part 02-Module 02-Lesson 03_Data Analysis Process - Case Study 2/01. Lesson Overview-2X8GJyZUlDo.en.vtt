Welcome to the second case study and enjoy the data analysis.

00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:08.774
In this lesson, you'll dive even deeper into Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib,

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:14.780
to analyze fuel economy data for different car models from 2008 and 2018.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.274
Like in the last case study,

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:20.399
you'll go through the entire data analysis process from start to finish on this dataset.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.890
You'll be exposed to new kinds of problems of data and different ways of handling them.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.164
You'll also learn new,

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:32.079
