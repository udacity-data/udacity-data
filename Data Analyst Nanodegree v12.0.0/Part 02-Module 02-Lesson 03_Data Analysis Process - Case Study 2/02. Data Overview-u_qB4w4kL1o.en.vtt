00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
Fuel economy data is collected from vehicle testing at

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.685
EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:10.675
The EPA provides this data to the government each year,

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:15.065
which the Department of Energy uses to publish their fuel economy guide.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:19.879
This data is available for download.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:22.864
You'll be analyzing data sets that are downloaded here,

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:27.265
for 2018 and 2008.

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.535
Here are the data sets for 2008 and 2018 in a Jupyter notebook.

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:35.600
There are probably a few features here that don't make too much sense to you.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.557
Before analyzing the data sets,

00:00:37.557 --> 00:00:41.350
you should take some time to understand this data and how it was collected.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.283
Luckily, there's good documentation for this.

00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:45.732
On the bottom of this page,

00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:48.839
there are two links to documentation for this data.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.785
This link downloads the readme file,

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.354
that provides some details about the data.

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:56.319
And this leads to documentation in a PDF that's

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.560
a bit clearer and more specific to the data set you'll be analyzing.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.895
It even has helpful links that provide more information about these features.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.040
You'll be using this documentation to answer

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.580
some questions about this data set in the next section.
