00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.760
Let's now do a residual outlier rejection.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.870
Let's assume we remove point B, we now refit the line with linear regression.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.440

would the steepness of the line be unchanged?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.890
Check one of the three
