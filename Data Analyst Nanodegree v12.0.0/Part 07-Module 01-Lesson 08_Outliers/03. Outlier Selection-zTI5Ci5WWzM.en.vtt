00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.500
So let's see if we can get an intuition.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.170
And the following examples are clearly contrived.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.270
And there's usually no simple answer to it.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.870
But bear with me and try to take the most obvious guess.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.510
I'm going to ask you the question.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.290
Which of the six datasets I'm drawing over here likely has some sort of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.500
an outlier?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.140
So I'm giving you six different diagrams.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.620
And again, the answer is not obvious, but if you feel you'd call this

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.500
an outlier, check the box and see if you can guess the way we will assess it.
