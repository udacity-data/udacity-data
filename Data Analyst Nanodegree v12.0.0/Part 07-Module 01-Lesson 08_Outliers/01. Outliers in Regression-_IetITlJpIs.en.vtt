00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.460
The line over here would describe the data, ignoring the outlier.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.400
But it will give us a huge least squares error over here,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.110
which has an enormous effect on the line.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.550
This one over here makes kind of no sense,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.160
because even though it pulls a little bit on the right side,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.460
it pulled the left side down, and gives a huge least squares error over here.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.630
So that really leaves this one as the most plausible line.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.610
And in reality, you might get something just like this.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.440
With a totally three over here is balanced with many of

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.640
these squares arrows on this side over here
