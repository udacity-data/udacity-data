00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.050
So, here's another data set, which it does have outliers.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.310
And, I want to, you imagine to fit a linear regression to this data,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.980
all the data points, and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.580
look at the resulting error of each data point, often called residual error,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.250
an error that the data point has after you fit the best possible line.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.190
And, I'm going to focus on three data points here.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.260
This one, called A, B, and C, and I want you to

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.350
check which of the three points you believe with the highest error, the highest

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.220
residual error after training, after you fit a linear regression to this.
