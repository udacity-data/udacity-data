00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.500
So, I'm going to give you a practical way to detect outliers that

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.540
work with almost every machine algorithm.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.460
It's actually really straightforward, and it's very very beautiful.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.440
Suppose you have this wonderful data set over here, with one outlier.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.750
Obviously, you don't know what the outlier is,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.310
because you haven't you haven't even discovered the structure of the linear set.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.680
The algorithm is very simple.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.490
Step one, Train with all the data.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.790
In our case, it would be linear regression.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.030
Two is Remove.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.390
Find after training, the points in your training set with the highest visitor

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.360
error, and remove those, perhaps usually remove 10% of your data points.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.420
And, step three is Train Again, using now the reduced data set.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.680
And, you can actually repeat this if you want, and do it multiple times.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.780
But, now our example over here, what it means is, the first time

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.050
we run the regression, we get something that looks approximately like this.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.943
And, while this is not a good regression, it is good enough to recognize that if

00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:56.010
you look at all the visible errors of data points,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.535
that this one over here has the largest.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:03.200
This happens to be ten points, so 10% of removal would remove exactly one point.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.430
So, we take this point out over here.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.450
Our new regression line would look pretty much like this.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.200
Which is what you want.
