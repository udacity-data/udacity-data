00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.400
And in this question, there's no best answer.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.980
I would say a very common one is sensor malfunction.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.750
So you often get sensors when a malfunction, they give it a zero.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.630
So, these zeros are often outliers.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.530
We have them a lot in robotics.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.630
Data entry errors are common when someone enters your data.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.930
I'd say aliens are not common causes of outliers.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.840
You might be able not to believe, but I won't check them, sorry.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.440
About freak events, sometimes you get a situation that is very unlikely.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.660
But that combination caused an extreme data point.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.670
And these are outliers you want to pay attention to.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.494
Those over here, you'd like to ignore, and those over here,

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:34.212
you'd like to pay attention to.

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:36.930
So in, in much of machine learning, we try to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.340
ignore the outliers because they often really caused by sensor malfunction.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.140
And when you over-fit them, you get really bad results.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.370
But there are fields, where people pay attention to the outliers.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.860
A common one would be fraud detection.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.900
Which is a special kind of anomaly detection.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.100
Where people really care about, is that something in the data that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.430
makes the report look so different, they should pay special attention to it.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.840
So, depending on your application, you might hate your outliers.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.940
Or you might love them.
