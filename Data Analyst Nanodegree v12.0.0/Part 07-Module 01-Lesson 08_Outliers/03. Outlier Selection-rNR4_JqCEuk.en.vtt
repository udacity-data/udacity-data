00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.740
And I would say the first one is probably an outlier,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.090
this data point over here seems to be really far away from the other Xs.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.000
This one isn't, it's non-linear, but it seems the data is very, very consistent.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.770
Whereas, here I'd say we do have an outlier because this data point over here

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.330
is far away.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.450
This one is interesting, and Katie and I debated it.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.080
You might call it an outlier or not.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.550
I did. And since I do this video, I get to choose.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.680
She didn't.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.750
I would say it's not outliers in space but also in class labels, but it

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.439
could also be just a single example of a different class that's not an outlier.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.140
So that's unclear.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220
This one to me looks more clear, the data point further away.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.340
And a single data point called an outlier is kind of, I don't know, crazy.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.120
So I would never call this thing here an outlier.
