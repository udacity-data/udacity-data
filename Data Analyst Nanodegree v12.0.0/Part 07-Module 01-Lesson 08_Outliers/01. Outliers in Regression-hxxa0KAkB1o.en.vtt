00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.480
We're going to talk now about something called outliers.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.730
I want to just draw a little example over here,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.640
to illustrate what an outlier might be.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.280
Suppose you're measuring some phenomena.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.680
And you're getting this amazing data.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.510
It looks almost like a line, and then there's this one data point.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.640
Now, in some cases that's really important.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.340
In other cases, it might just be the result of a little measurement error.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.650
So whoever typed in the data into the spreadsheet, mistyped and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.430
instead of saying 20, types 200.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.040
It's a very common thing that you get data where some phenomena that's very

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.020
rare, corrupts individual data points.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.380
Either way, this thing is called an outlier,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.245
because it lays way outside the other data.

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.040
And I'm going to give you a little quiz here.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.680
If you did linear regression, and I give you three hypotheses for

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.690
what the best linear regression is.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.350
Which one do you think is the best of the three?

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.120
This one?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.100
This one?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.890
Or, this one?

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.630
Please check the appropriate line,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.710
if you think under consideration of the outlier.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.260
And assuming that linear regression minimized the least squared error.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.740
Tell me, which you think are the best to describe the data?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.460
None of them are perfect
