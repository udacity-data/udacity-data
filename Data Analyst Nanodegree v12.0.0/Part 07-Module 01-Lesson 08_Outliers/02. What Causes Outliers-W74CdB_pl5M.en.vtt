00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.850
So one of the questions we always have is what causes outliers?

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.470
And I give you a couple of hypotheses,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.590
one is sensor malfunction, one is data entry errors.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.750
If someone types in data by hand, it's really easy to just get a digit wrong.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.770
One is aliens, and one is freak events.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.560
Things that happen very,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.380
very rarely, but they do happen, and they might even be important.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.470
Sort of like plausible ways to explain outliers.
