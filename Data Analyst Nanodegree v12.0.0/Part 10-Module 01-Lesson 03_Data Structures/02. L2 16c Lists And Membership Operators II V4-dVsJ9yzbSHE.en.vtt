00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.970
So, how are lists different from strings?

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:08.279
You saw that both support indexing,

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.704
slicing, and the in operator.

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:15.175
The most obvious difference is that strings are sequences of letters,

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:18.580
while list elements can be any type of object.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.344
Or more subtle difference is that lists can be modified but strings can't.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:31.199
Here, we can change the fourth element index three of this list to Friday, if you want.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.339
But here, we get an error if we tried to change the third element of a string.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.170
The technical term for whether an object can be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.010
modified after its creation is mutability.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.625
We can modify the values of lists.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.140
So, a list is an mutable data type.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.399
We can't modify strings,

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.454
so a string is an immutable data type.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:56.238
As we introduce more data types,

00:00:56.238 --> 00:00:59.324
there are two factors that we will continue to consider.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:03.585
One is mutability, and the other is order.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:08.204
Order is whether the order of contents for an object matters,

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:13.069
and whether or not, part of the object can be accessed using this order.

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:16.189
Both strings and lists are ordered,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.944
which is why indexing works well for them.

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:23.000
However, one is mutable while the other is not.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.519
We will see more data types that fall under

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.685
different sections of this grid as we continue.

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:33.890
For now, we'll explore the methods and functions that work on lists,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.719
and we'll take advantage of list mutability in our programs.
