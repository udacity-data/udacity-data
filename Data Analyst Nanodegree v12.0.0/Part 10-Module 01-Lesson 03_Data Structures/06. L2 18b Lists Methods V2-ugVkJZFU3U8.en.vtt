00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.155
Let's introduce a new string method that works with lists, join().

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:11.324
Join takes a list as an argument and returns a string

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.199
consisting of the list elements joined by separator string.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.515
In this example, we use a string,

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:20.085
backslash and as a separator,

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:24.010
so that there's a new line between each element, fore,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.605
new line, aft, new line,

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.185
starboard, new line, port.

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:32.884
We can also use other strings as separators with join.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.054
Here, we use a hyphen.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:37.859
It's important to remember to separate each of

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.000
the items in the list you're joining with a comma.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.984
Forgetting to do so will not trigger an error,

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:46.719
but will also give you unexpected results.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.574
In the example below,

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:53.540
omitting a comma between Garcia and O'Kelley results in the following;

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.740
Notice how the hyphen separator is missing between Garcia and O'Kelley,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.655
and instead, the two strings were appended.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:06.454
This happens because of Python's default string literal appending.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:09.795
If join returns different results than expected,

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:11.900
check for missing commas.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.295
Also, note that join will trigger an error,

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:18.144
if we tried to join anything other than strings.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:23.004
We get an error here because an integer was included in the lists.

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.280
Lastly, a helpful method called append,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.745
adds an element to the end of the lists.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:33.520
Next, you'll practice working with lists and explore more list methods.
