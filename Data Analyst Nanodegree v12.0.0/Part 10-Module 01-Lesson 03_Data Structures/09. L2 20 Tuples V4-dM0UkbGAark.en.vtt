00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.084
Python provides another useful container, tuples.

00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:11.359
Tuples are used to store related pieces of information.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:17.954
A tuple is a data structure in Python that is an immutable ordered sequence of elements.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:22.389
Consider this example involving latitude and longitude.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.710
Tuples are similar to lists in that they store

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.219
an ordered collection of objects which can be accessed by their indices.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:34.405
For example, location zero and location one.

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:38.454
Unlike lists, however, tuples are immutable.

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:43.530
You cannot add or remove items from tuples or sort them in place.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.905
Why do we have tuples if they're lists with fewer features?

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:52.310
Tuples are useful when you have two or more values that are so closely

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.070
related that they will always be used together like latitude and longitude coordinates.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.649
Tuples can also be used to assign multiple variables in a compact way.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.984
Notice that the values assigned to the tuple dimensions

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:10.885
aren't surrounded with parentheses as previous examples were.

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:14.510
The parentheses are optional when making tuples and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.075
programmers frequently omit them if parentheses don't clarify the code.

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:20.719
In the second line,

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.644
three variables are assigned from the content of the tuple dimensions.

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:27.363
This is called tuple unpacking.

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:31.700
You can use tuple unpacking to assign the information from a tuple

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.439
into multiple variables without having to access them one by one,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.875
and make multiple assignment statements.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:43.629
In this example, if we won't need to use dimensions directly,

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:46.250
we could shorten those two lines of code into

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.420
a single line that assigns three variables in one go.
