00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.910
In the elements dictionary we saw earlier,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.675
element names which are strings are mapped to their atomic numbers, which are integers.

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.595
But what if we wanted to store more information about each element,

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:17.769
like their weight and symbol.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.660
We can do that by adjusting this dictionary so that it maps

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.359
the element names to another dictionary that stores that collection of data.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.189
We can look up information about an entry in

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.840
this nested dictionary in the same way as we did before.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.775
With square brackets or the get method.

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:40.574
We can look up specific information from the Helium dictionary like this.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.030
This code is first looking up the key helium in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.245
the elements dictionary producing the Helium dictionary.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:50.324
The second lookup weight,

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:56.160
then looks up the weight key in that Helium dictionary to find helium's atomic weight.
