00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
Welcome to this lesson on data structures.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.460
So far, you've dealt with variables representing individual basic data types,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.460
like integers, floats, Booleans, and strings.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.330
In this lesson, you'll learn how to group and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.225
order these data types into different data structures,

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:22.010
namely: lists, tuples, sets,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.515
dictionaries, and compound data structures.

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:27.179
You'll also learn about the last two types of

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.963
operators in Python: membership and identity,

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:35.679
along with more built-in functions and methods. Let's get started.
