00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.590
I argue vice, I argue nice occurs once.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.350
Day actually occurs twice now.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.920
So you have a dual occurrence of day.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.095
And for the word loves, you can argue.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.189
In the strict sense, the answer is zero, and

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.800
this is what I asked you to do here.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.220
But advanced techniques for bag-of-words tend to just look at

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.750
the stem of a word, which is love, and count it.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.440
But the way I asked the question, it should have been zero.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.400
Just be aware that later on, as you use actual tools, loves and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.550
love might end up in the same bucket on the right side.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.160
But I think you got the principle.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.270
It's just a frequency count.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.357
So let me ask you a few question about the technique of bag-of-words.
