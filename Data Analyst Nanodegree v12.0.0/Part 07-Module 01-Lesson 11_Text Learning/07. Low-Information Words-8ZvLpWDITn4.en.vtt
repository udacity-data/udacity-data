00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.380
This is a little bit of a judgement call to say exactly which ones you

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.140
think are low information.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.930
because it kind of depends on what you're looking for.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.980
But here are a few that are classically just not

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.110
going to have that much information.

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:16.756
The word the. The word the shows up in almost every message that you're ever

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:17.600
going to see.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.950
So the fact that the word the shows up doesn't really tell you what

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.110
the message is about, because it's always going to be there.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
I would say the same thing is probably true of the word will.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.312
And in this context also,

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:31.920
where we're looking at emails, I bet the word hi occurs a lot.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.830
And so seeing the word hi doesn't necessarily tell you anything very

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.240
specific about what the message is about.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.850
You could've also said that Katie and Sebastian are low information words,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.880
because every message has these two words in them.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.250
All the messages are about Katie and/or Sebastian, so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.040
knowing that those words are there isn't necessarily telling you anything.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.130
But I would argue that usually names are something that you would want to

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.790
be able to keep.
