00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.170
So now let's do a quick quiz talking about the order of

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.110
operations in text processing.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.920
We've talked about two important steps that you'll use often when

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.000
you're doing text processing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.210
One is the bag of words representation, and the other is word stemming.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.470
And here's a quiz for you.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.860
Let's suppose that you want to do both these operations to your text.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.710
You want to have stemmed words in a bag of words representation.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.730
Which one of these steps should you do first?
