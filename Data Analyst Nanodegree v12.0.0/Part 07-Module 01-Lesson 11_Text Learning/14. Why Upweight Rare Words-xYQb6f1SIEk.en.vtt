00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.540
So, let's suppose you got a bunch of emails that, some of them came from me, and

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.460
some of them came from Sebastian.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.820
We might have a lot of overlap.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.110
We might both be talking about machine learning and Udacity.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.470
But some of them are going to be talking about, let's say physics.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.600
Because that's what my background is in.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.230
And that's going to be comparatively rare.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.400
There's not going to be tons and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.690
tons of emails in that corpus that are talking about physics.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.850
Because most all of Sebastian's are, don't talk about physics at all.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.802
It's only going to be mine.

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:28.160
And then likewise,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.680
maybe there's a bunch of emails that talk about Stanley the robot.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.580
Which of course is one of his projects, but

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.670
not something that I'm a real expert in.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.080
So, the fact that words like physics and Stanley would be rare in this corpus,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.630
compared to words like Udacity or machine learning.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.840
Means that these might be the words that tell you the most important

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.700
information about what's going on.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.890
Who might be the author of a given message?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.160
And so, another way to think about that is that this is why it's called

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.920
the inverse document frequency.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.660
That you want to weight the words by inverse of how often they

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.250
appear in the corpus as a whole.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.900
I'm not going to have you code an example of Tf Idf right now, as a quiz.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.650
But this is something that we're going to cover in

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.930
the mini project that's coming up very shortly, at the end of this lesson.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.620
So, you will get your hands dirty with this representation a little bit.
