00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.000
And the key thing to know for
关键是要知道

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.060
bag of words is that the word order does not matter.
词序并不重要 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.720
It's clearly a no, because we are counting words we have no preference to where in
这显然是一个不 因为我们计算的单词 我们没有偏好在哪里

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.160
the phrase a word occurs,
一个词出现的短语,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.050
which kind of make it somewhat limited compared to really understanding a text.
与真正理解文本相比 这有点局限 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.100
It's kind of taking all the words and resorting them in random order.
这是一种把所有的单词随机排列的方式 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.860
That's why it's called bag of words.
这就是为什么它被称为词语袋 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.265
Because you toss them into a bag.
因为你把它们扔进袋子里 

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:24.861
And gone they are.
他们都走了 

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:26.750
Long phrases do give different vectors.
长词组确实给出了不同的矢量 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.660
So suppose we take the same email and duplicate it.
所以假设我们使用同一封邮件并复制它 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.540
All the counts go up by a factor of two, and
所有的计数都增加了两倍 而且

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.810
it's going to be a different input vector.
这将是一个不同的输入矢量 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.870
So to some extent you're biasing yourself to also encode the length of your text
所以在某种程度上 你是在偏向自己 以便同时编码文本的长度

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.780
not just the frequency of the words, so the answer would be clearly yes.
不仅仅是单词的频率 所以答案很明显是肯定的 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.500
And I would say, can we handle complex phrases.
我会说 我们能处理复杂的短语吗 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.050
Right now we can't, unless we make extra buckets for
现在我们不能 除非我们多做一些桶

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.820
those, which makes it a bit more difficult to preprocess.
这使得预处理变得更加困难 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.430
Chicago Bulls would count one for Chicago and one for Bulls.
芝加哥公牛队将为芝加哥公牛队计一分 公牛队计一分 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.760
And here's a funny little insight,
这里有一个有趣的观点,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.480
when Google first came out as a search engine and you typed in Chicago Bulls.
当谷歌第一次出现作为一个搜索引擎 你在芝加哥公牛输入 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.989
You saw lots of, of, of references to cities and lots of references to animals.
你可以看到很多 很多关于城市和动物的参考资料 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.480
And so a, a bunch of smart Google engineers to change the dictionary to also
于是 一群聪明的谷歌工程师把字典也改成了

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.760
included combined phrases like Chicago Bulls.
包括像芝加哥公牛队这样的组合短语 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.490
So go to Google, try it out.
所以去谷歌上试试吧 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.730
I promise you you see very few animals and very few cities.
我向你保证 你看到的动物很少 城市也很少
