00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.560
And these are all yes, no questions.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.740
Question number one, does the, the word order matter inside of a phrase?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.770
Yes or no?

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.890
Do long text or phrases give fundamentally different input vectors?

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.300
Yes or no?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.710
Or put differently, if I just take the same email and make ten copies and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.050
put all the ten copies into a,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.020
like the same text, will I get something different, yes or no?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.220
And finally, can we really handle complex phrases involving multiple words?

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.060
Classic example in the US is Chicago Bulls is actually a sports team,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.920
where Chicago itself is just a city, and Bulls is an animal.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.171
But the conjunction of these two words means something entirely different from

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:46.400
the words insulation.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.980
Again, yes or no?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.600
Give it a try.
