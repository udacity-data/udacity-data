00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.110
The answer that you should have gotten is 127.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.600
Here's how I figured it out.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.160
You can repeat the steps just like I showed you in the last video.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.280
And then you just need to call length on the sw list, and

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.880
that will give you the number of elements in sw.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.461
Which is the number of stopwords, 127
