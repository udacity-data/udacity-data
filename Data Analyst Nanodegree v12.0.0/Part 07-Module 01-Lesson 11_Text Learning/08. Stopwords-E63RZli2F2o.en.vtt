00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.310
Some words just usually don't contain a lot of information.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.260
And it can be really valuable to have an eye out for these words.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.990
And to be able to just sort of remove them from your corpus, so

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.120
you don't have to to consider them.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.770
You don't allow them to become noise in your dataset.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.800
In general, this list of words is called stopwords.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.830
And the exact definition of what a stopword is can vary.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.540
But in general, it's a low information word that occurs very frequently.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.660
Some examples might include words like and, the, I, you and have.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.550
And a very common pre-processing step in text analysis,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.710
is to remove the stopwords before you do anything else with the data.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.270
Suppose that our body of stopwords is the, in, for, you, will, have and be.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.680
Say I just give these to you and say, by fiat, these are the stock words.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.640
My question for you in a quiz,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.280
is how many words will be removed when we remove the stopwords from the message,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.080
hi Katie, the machine learning class will be great.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.840
Best, Sebastian
