00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.180
Between stemming and the bag of words approach I think you're ready to do

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.610
a lot of really interesting things in text learning.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.330
There's one more representation that I want to teach you before we quit

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.290
though because it's really, really cool.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.379
It's called the Tf Idf representation.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.060
Tf stands for term frequency.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.670
Idf stands for inverse document frequency.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.490
And the rough idea is this.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.000
The term frequency part is very similar to the bag of words.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.570
What this means is that each term, each word, is going to be up-weighted by

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.450
how often it occurs in a document, just like it is in bag of words.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.580
If you have a word that occurs ten times,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.890
it's going to have ten times as much weight as a word that occurs only once.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.140
The inverse document frequency part is new though.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.020
And the idea here is that the word also gets a weighting that's related to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.470
how often it occurs in the corpus as a whole, in all the documents put together.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.630
And here's a quiz to make you think about this weighting in a very careful way.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.710
The question is this.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.640
What do you thing makes more sense if you want to be extracting information from

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.080
these words?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.420
Will you give a higher weight to the very common words that occur in many,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.720
many documents, or would you give a higher weight to the rare words?

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.119
The words that might only occur in let's say 10% or

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.290
1% of the documents that are present in your corpus.
