00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.110
And now, of course, we find that our future vector looks like this.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.510
We had four words over here.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.020
We only get a count of three because we didn't pay attention to A.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.590
A is often called a stop word.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.440
It tends to be removed from text learning.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.100
Such as the, of, and other stop words.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.140
But the key words here are nice, very, day, and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.550
you can see how these two feature vectors of the same dimension,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.300
it estimated six, but they can be applied to different text.
