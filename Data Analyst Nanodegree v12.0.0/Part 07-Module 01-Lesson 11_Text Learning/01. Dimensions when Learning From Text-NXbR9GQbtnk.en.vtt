00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.719
So one of the most exciting developments in machine learning is

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.640
learning from text.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.260
A lot of the online data is actually text data, the web, emails and so on.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.210
And companies like Google, Yahoo!,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.500
and many others are really built on the idea that you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.600
can use machine learning and apply it to text.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.860
So if you want to build the next Google, listen up.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.600
The fundamental question in learning from text has to do

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.150
with what's the input feature.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.780
And I'm going to give an example and ask you a question.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.144
Suppose you have two strings, two kind of sentences.

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:40.210
One is called nice day, and one is called a very nice day.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.090
And suppose for whatever reason, one is a positive example.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.070
And one of the negative examples is indicated by this X over here and

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.710
this circle.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.780
And maybe if many of those, and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
you want to toss them into your favorite learning algorithm like the support

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.440
vector machine to produce either output label.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.510
What do you think is the best input dimension for the support vector machine?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.390
Give you a few choices, one, two, three, four or hard to tell.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.690
Give it a best shot.
