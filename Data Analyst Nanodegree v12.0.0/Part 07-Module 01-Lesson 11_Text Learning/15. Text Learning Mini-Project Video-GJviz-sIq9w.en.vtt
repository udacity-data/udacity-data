00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.890
Welcome to the mini project on text learning.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.980
I want you to think back to some of the earlier lessons in this class,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.570
where you were identifying the author of an email based on

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.410
the words that they were using in the emails that they sent.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.045
Now you have much more of appreciation for all the work that goes into

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:21.010
preprocessing text before you can feed it into a naive Bayes classifier, an SVM,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.380
or anything like that.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.310
We took care of all that preprocessing for

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.880
you at the beginning, but now you're going to sort of open that black box.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.430
You're going to put all those things together yourself so

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.520
that you can start with what's effectively a raw email, and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.410
then at the end of this mini project, you'll have output that's ready to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.880
go straight into a supervised classification algorithm.
