00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.680
Now that you know about stop words, I'm going to show you how to get a list of

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.550
stop words out of a Python package called NLTK, which stands for

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.110
the natural language tool kit.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.400
In this demonstration, I'm going to be using the interpreter.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.520
At the end of this video, there will be a quiz, and

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.390
I want you to do the quiz on your own laptop, not in the Udacity web browser.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.480
So this quiz is a little bit different.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.760
So, let's get started.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.720
I fire up the interpreter.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.100
To get the stopwords out, I have to import them from NLTK.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.110
I found this line of code in an example when I went to Google looking for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.460
how to get stopwords from NLTK.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.850
To get a list of stopwords, say something like sw equal stopwords.words.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.440
And then as a parameter to words,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.176
I have to tell it what language I am interested in.

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:49.906
That's English.

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:52.760
And [LAUGH] if you are using NLTK for

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.180
the first time like I am on this computer you'll get an error because NLTK

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.900
needs to have a corpus from which it gets the stopwords.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.190
The corpus is just a body of documents.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.430
So in order to fix this, I have to call this nltk.download function.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.520
You have to make sure NLTK is imported first, and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.520
then what we need is the corpora and then we hit download.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.470
This will take a few minutes.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.000
And now that that's finished, I can try again.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.690
Much better.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.150
So I can go into this sw list and I can ask what some of the stock words are.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.560
So the first one in the list, is the word i.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.200
That makes sense, people like to talk about themselves a lot.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.370
Let's find out what the tenth one is.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.430
Yours.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.670
Again, makes sense.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.490
What I want you to do

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.310
in the quiz now is to repeat these steps that I went through.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.810
So, use your Python interpreter to actually download the corpus and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.550
to get the list of stop words out.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.350
And here's my question for you.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.490
How many stop words are in the list?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.460
Write your answer in this box
