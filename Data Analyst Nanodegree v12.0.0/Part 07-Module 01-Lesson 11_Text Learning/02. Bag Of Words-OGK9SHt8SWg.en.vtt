00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.160
So in learning from text, one of the fundamental problems we

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.270
have is that the length of each document that you learn from, each email or

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.710
each book title, is non-standardized.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.290
So you can't just use each individual word as an input feature,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.550
because then long emails would require different input space than short emails.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.975
Instead, one of the coolest things in machine learning from text,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:31.690
which analyze all these approaches, is called bag of words.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.370
And the basic idea is to take any text and count the frequency of words,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.640
which you do for me in a second.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.190
So the trick is to impose a dictionary.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.760
So you have all the words you know.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.470
Obviously, they include words like nice, very, day.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.440
It might include words that don't occur on the left side, like he, she, love.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.660
So say these are the words you care about.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.110
Notice that there's one on the left side that doesn't occur on the right side.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.880
Then you can map each phrase, each email, each title,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.970
each text, into a frequency count defined over these six features over here.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.470
So let's do this.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.280
I give you six boxes for each of the six words in our dictionary.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.880
Of all the words you care about, can you for the very first sentence, nice day,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.600
fill in the frequency count of those words in this text and give me that vector?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.970
So in particular, for each word over here,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.370
you tell me how often it occurs in nice day.
