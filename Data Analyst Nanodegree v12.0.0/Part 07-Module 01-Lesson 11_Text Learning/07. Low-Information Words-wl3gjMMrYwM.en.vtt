00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.720
Now that you have bag-of-words running,

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.040
you're really able to start doing high level text analysis right away.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.570
But, I want you to think about something else when

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.470
you're doing text analysis as well.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.360
And, that is that, when it comes to vocabulary, not all words are equal.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.880
Another way to think about this,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.950
is that some words contain more information than others.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.640
And in order to get you thinking about this,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.240
what I'm going to do is give you a quiz.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.730
I'm going to give you a set of words.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
And I want you to check the words that are low information.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.970
You don't technically know what this means yet.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.410
But just think about your intuition.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.460
Which words do you think are giving you information about what's going on in

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.470
the text?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.390
And what words just aren't that helpful to help you understand what's going on?

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.560
Let's suppose that our corpus is the same sort of standard set of

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.020
messages that we've been looking at so far.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.480
So our vocabulary contains the words, hi,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.920
Katie, Sebastian, will, the, driving, machine, learning, and great.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.180
Obviously all of these words show up in the messages, at least once.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.130
Now check the ones you think aren't really telling you that much about what

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.390
might be going on in the message.
