00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.120
And this is another quiz where of course we

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.790
haven't already given you the answer.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.110
Hopefully you had to think about it a little bit.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.820
The answer is that you want to do stemming before you do the bag of

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.960
words representation and that's for two reasons.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.630
The first one is if you put it in the bag of words representation before you

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
stem then there's kind of no point in stemming because you could get

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.780
the same word repeated many times within your bag of words representation.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.770
You're not really like condensing the information in any useful way.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.330
In fact, you're probably making it noisier and worse.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.800
because you'll just have the word sponse in there six times.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.940
Also it's more technically feasible to apply stemming first and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.710
then put it in the bag of words representation.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.120
Because stemming is going to assume a string.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.550
And the bag of words representation is going to look like some kind of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.560
matrix that has many different documents and, and words within those documents.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.160
So you almost always want to do stemming as one of

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.140
the first steps in your text processing.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.160
You go through and you stem each word and then put it into

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.900
the representation that you'll use in your machine learning algorithm.
