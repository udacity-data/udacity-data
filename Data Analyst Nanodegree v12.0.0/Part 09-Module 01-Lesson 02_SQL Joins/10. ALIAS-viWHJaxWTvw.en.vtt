00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
When performing joins, it's easiest to give your table names aliases.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:07.144
Orders is a pretty long and annoying name to type.

00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:09.480
O is much easier.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.089
You can give a table an alias by adding a space after

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.449
the table name and typing the intended name of the alias.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.119
As with column names,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.450
the best practice here is to use

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.535
all lower case letters and underscores instead of spaces.

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:25.135
Now that we've given our tables aliases,

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:29.465
we can refer to columns in the select clause by using those alias names.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.379
We can also do the same thing anywhere else

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.854
in the query that columns from these tables appear.

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:37.409
In this case, the only other places the ON clause.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.289
As you can see, the results are exactly the

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.000
same as the previous query without the aliases.
