00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
Awesome work! You've made it to the end of this section on reviewing existing commits.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.009
Remember, that being able to display

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.550
a repository's history can be especially helpful when you're first starting out.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.464
It's beneficial to know what's being stored in a commit,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.570
and how to view it after the commit is made.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.240
You know, we keep talking about commits and have been

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.609
reviewing all of these existing commits,

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.789
I think it's time we actually make our first commit. What do you think?

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.318
In the next lesson,

00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:30.105
you'll learn about making commits,

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.268
viewing a file's changes before the commit is made,

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:36.000
telling it to not track specific files and more.
