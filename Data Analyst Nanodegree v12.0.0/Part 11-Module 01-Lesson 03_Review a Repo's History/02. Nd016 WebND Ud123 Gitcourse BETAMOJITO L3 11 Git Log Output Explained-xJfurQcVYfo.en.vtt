00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.378
We're looking at the log of commits that have been made in this repository.

00:00:04.378 --> 00:00:07.649
This is one commit, here is another.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.019
Look at all of the information that the log is displaying.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.765
It's showing the commits SHA,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:14.737
the person who made the commit,

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:16.454
the date the commit was made,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:18.809
and the message for the commit.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.984
This is just a short description of what changes were made in this commit.

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:26.850
Now these are just the first three or so commits that can fit on the screen.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.260
There are plenty more.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.615
How do I know that? The colon here

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:33.420
means that there are more lines of output to be displayed.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.520
If you're familiar with the command line,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.845
GIT uses the less program as its pager.

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:41.729
If you're not familiar with less or pagers that's no problem.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.739
A pager is used to page through content.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.550
This is just the command line e-way of scrolling.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.619
Press either the J key or the down arrow to scroll down one line at a time.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.280
To scroll up press the K key or the up arrow.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.314
You'll know you've reached the very last commit when the colon changes to the word end.

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:04.170
To get out of the pager just press the Q key.
