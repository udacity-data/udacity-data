00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.945
I've got two terminals open and both are located in the blog project.

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:10.835
Let's run git log in this one and git log --oneline over here.

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:13.755
The line holds the information for just one commit.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.800
It's the first seven characters of the SHA,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.554
and then the commit message.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.890
Here's the SHA for the most recent commit.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.719
And here's the same commit with the full SHA.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.629
See how the first six characters are the same.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.919
This commit here is this one.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.595
And here's the second commit.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:32.185
And here it is over here.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.135
So nothing has changed in the repo.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:38.780
The --oneline flag just alters the way the information is displayed.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.899
It's a pretty helpful command,

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.000
if you want to quickly review a repository's commits.
