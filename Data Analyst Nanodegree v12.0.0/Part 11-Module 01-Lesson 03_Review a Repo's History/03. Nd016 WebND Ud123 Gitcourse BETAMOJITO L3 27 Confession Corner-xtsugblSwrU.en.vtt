00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
I have a confession to make.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:05.088
When I first learned about the oneline flag for git log,

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.095
I was really excited about it.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.818
Now I didn't have to scroll and scroll and scroll to read all of the comment messages.

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:15.420
It worked for a couple of times until one time I got this.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.864
Why isn't it working now?

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:18.574
I tried restarting the terminal.

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:23.350
That didn't do anything. I restarted my computer and that didn't help.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.685
Finally, I actually read Git's helpful error message carefully.

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:31.479
I had typed out "online" instead of oneline.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.039
It says, "fatal: unrecognized argument: --online."

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.905
Online is unrecognized, which means Git doesn't know about it.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.175
This error message, or something similar,

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.399
is common to run into while programming.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.807
So, keep an eye out for it.

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:49.340
Unfound or unrecognized arguments often mean a simple spelling mistake.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.435
So, the moral of the story, spelling is important.

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:56.135
Make sure you actually spell things correctly.

00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:59.019
Also, Git will try and provide helpful feedback.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.400
Make sure you read it carefully.
