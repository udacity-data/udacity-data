00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.460
The visualizations you create will give you insights into

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.914
the data that you can't get from descriptive statistics.

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:15.939
A plot can immediately tell you if your data is symmetric or skewed,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.458
if it is unimodal or multimodal.

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:24.125
Plots can also indicate interesting areas for further investigation and clarification.

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:28.109
Categories in a bar chart with low counts might point to errors in

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.604
the data or if you see that bars have values that counter your expectations,

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:37.924
then that might point towards further research or a revisiting of data assumptions.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:43.204
For example, let's say you're looking at a distribution of user birth months.

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.289
Seeing an unusually large number of

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.769
January responses might suggest a deeper investigation such as whether

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.810
there are a lot of users who are just submitting

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.780
default information or if there's something wrong with how the data has been recorded.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.679
In a histogram, one of the most salient bits of information

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.659
that you can observe is whether or not there are outliers in your data.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.519
If the plot covers an unexpected range,

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.699
this can point to the presence of unusual points that are worth further investigation.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.144
In some cases, like if you have highly skewed data,

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:18.789
you might want to change the range of the data plotted in

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.920
order to zoom into parts that are more interesting.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.689
Rather than filtering on the original data,

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.530
you can simply make changes to the axis limits to make your observations.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.275
Let's say that we make a plot of ride durations in minutes for a bike-sharing service,

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:35.594
and obtain a plot as shown.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:39.414
There are a few outliers in the last bar from 1,400 to

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:44.455
1,500 minutes that cause all of the other points to be fit into the first bar.

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:47.804
While we might want to look at those outlier points later,

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:50.140
we could first just change the axis limits

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.170
to see the shape of where most of the data points lie.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.144
When we limit the axis to 60 minutes,

00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:58.194
and use bins of five-minutes wide,

00:01:58.194 --> 00:01:59.899
we get a clear picture that

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.960
the typical ride length lies between five and 15-minute range.
