00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.609
If you have a quantitative variable,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.830
then your univariate plot of choice will probably be the histogram.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.149
Similar to a bar chart you have feature values on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.390
However, due to the numeric nature of the data,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.859
bars in a histogram do not indicate counts on

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.939
single values but instead counts on value ranges.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.310
In this histogram, we have plotted 30 values with bins of size three.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.050
The first bin on the left counts two data

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.704
points that take a value between zero and three,

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:43.744
the second bin counts four points between three and six and so on.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:49.429
Normally, bins include values on their left end and exclude values on their right end.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.329
So the datapoint with value 6.0 will go into the bin on its right.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.289
The size of the bins can have a major effect on how you interpret the data.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.539
If your bin size is too large,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.549
then you may end up losing a lot of information about the overall distribution of data.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.209
On the opposite side, a too small bin size can

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:14.114
introduce noise that can distract from the main trends in your data.

00:01:14.114 --> 00:01:16.199
When creating a histogram,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.820
it's a good idea to play around with different settings for the bin sizes and

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.119
boundary points to achieve a good understanding of the plotted variable.
