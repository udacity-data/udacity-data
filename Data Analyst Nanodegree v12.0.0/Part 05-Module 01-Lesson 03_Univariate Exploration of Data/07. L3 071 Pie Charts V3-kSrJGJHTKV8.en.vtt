00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:09.539
You're probably familiar with one other plot type that is used for

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.174
plotting relative frequencies for qualitative variables, the pie chart.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.800
In a pie chart, each category is indicated by a slice of

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.804
a circle with the area indicating the relative frequency of that category.

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:25.855
A variant of the pie chart, the donut plot,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:31.380
is very similar except that the center of the circle has been removed, leaving a donut.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:37.500
Most of the time, you'll probably prefer a bar chart over either on these two plots.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.039
It is actually fairly difficult to get an accurate estimate of

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.835
relative frequency from a pie or donut plot alone.

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.060
If there are a lot of categories,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.575
there are major limitations on how many categories can be plotted in a readable way.

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:56.020
A bar chart will usually be more versatile and should be

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.269
your first choice for exploring qualitative variables.

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:03.519
That's not to say that pie or donut charts should never be used however.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.034
If you want to use one of these charts,

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.819
then you should keep in mind a few guidelines.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.169
First of all, you only want to use a pie chart if you want to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.734
show how the whole of the data is broken down into parts.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:20.319
Second, you should plan on only plotting a small number of slices.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.579
A pie chart works best with two or three slices,

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.859
so that the relative portions are distinct.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.644
If you determine that a pie chart meet these two criteria,

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:35.574
you should then organize your plot to clearly convey the information in your data.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:38.915
Usually, you should start planning from the 12 o'clock position and

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.690
then mark slices clockwise in order of frequency.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.125
There are other reasonable ways of generating a pie chart,

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.969
but you should consider your data carefully about both

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.799
whether you should use a pie chart and how best to present it.
