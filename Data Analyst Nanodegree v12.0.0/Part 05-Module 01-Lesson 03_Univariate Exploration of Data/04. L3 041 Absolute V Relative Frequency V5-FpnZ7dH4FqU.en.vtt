00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.179
The bar charts you saw in the previous concept were all encoded with

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.779
the absolute frequency or number of data points on the length axis.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.984
However, in some cases,

00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:17.460
you might instead be interested in

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.450
the relative frequency or what proportion of the data falls in each category.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.589
For example; Let's say that we have daily air quality data from three cities for a year.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.390
If we are interested in estimating the proportion of

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.234
days that saw good air quality from our plot,

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:39.649
then trying to do this from the plot of counts require us to do some estimation work.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.310
We would need to estimate the relative area of the Good bar to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.895
all the bars together or have to do some mental calculations of some.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:51.609
Changing the Count axis to relative proportions makes it

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.024
much easier to see how much each category contributes to the whole.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:59.710
We can just read the height of the Good bar on the vertical axis and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.799
find that almost 70 percent of days had good air quality.
