00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.400
If you're interested in the distribution of a qualitative variable,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.845
your primary visualization of choice will probably be the bar chart.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:17.160
Usually, a bar chart is constructed so that each level of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.510
the categorical variable has a unique x position while

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.640
the height of each bar illustrates the frequency or count

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.899
of the number of times a data point took on each categorical value.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.250
For example, let's say we gathered

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.799
some survey data and wanted to count the genders of respondents.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:38.250
This bar chart translate the tabular summary into bar heights.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.159
You can see that the count of males is halfway between

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.129
the 400 and 500 tick marks and the count of females closer to 600 then 500.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.645
To avoid information distortion,

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.560
the baseline for the plot should start from zero.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.410
If we plotted our example from my 400 baseline instead,

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.409
then the bar lengths would apply there to be

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.319
three and a half times more females than males rather than about 28% more.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.469
For nominal data, you might want to arrange the bars

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.724
in order of frequency with the most common on the left.

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:12.679
This makes it easy to see which category is the most

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.045
common and how the rest of the categories compare.

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:19.670
You should not be inclined to do this with ordinal data.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.335
The inherent order of the levels will usually be a more important feature to convey.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:28.265
It's more important to know if the most common categories are lower

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:32.555
or higher in the spectrum rather than just which label is the most frequent.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:37.625
Consider this bar chart a survey responses taken on a five-point scale.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:41.814
The highest bar on the left shows that the mode response was agree.

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:45.640
However, this hides the fact that when opinions are put in

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.375
their inherent ordering from strongly disagree to strongly agree,

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:54.140
the responses were highly polarized between agreement and disagreement.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.510
One common variation that you might see for bar charts is the horizontal bar chart.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.990
In this variation, the chart has essentially turned 90 degrees clockwise

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.449
such that the Y positions indicate category and the X-linked indicates frequency.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.634
This does not change what is conveyed by your plot,

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:17.169
but it's useful to keep in mind depending on how your data is structured.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:21.449
If you have a lot of categories or the category names are long,

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.839
then the horizontal orientation can be more

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.250
convenient in terms of the space needed to create a readable plot.
