00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.960
We start our exploration of any data set with

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.315
univariate visualizations or visualizations of single variables.

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:13.674
By looking at one variable at a time,

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.074
we can build an intuition for how each variable is distributed

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:21.515
before moving on to more complicated interactions between variables.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.324
When you start looking at any data set,

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.660
keep in mind the goals of your investigation and explore

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.495
the variables that will be key to answering your research questions.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:36.500
If we observe any oddities in the data such as outliers, or missing values,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.399
this can point us to areas where we need to do

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.905
more cleaning or otherwise perform further inspection.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:44.600
It often makes sense to integrate this part of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.710
the exploration process into parts of the data wrangling process.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.149
This lesson will focus on two different plot types,

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.039
bar charts for qualitative variables and histograms for quantitative variables.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.984
While both of these plot types take the appearance of rectangles on a pair of axes,

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:05.429
you will see how datatype makes these plots distinct.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.650
You will also learn how to use code to create these plots

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.240
as well as how to use these plots to gain an understanding of your data.
