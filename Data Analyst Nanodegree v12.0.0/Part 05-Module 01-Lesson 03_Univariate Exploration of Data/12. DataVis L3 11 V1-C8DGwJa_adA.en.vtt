00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's try creating another histogram of a different Pokemon attribute, height.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.365
The units for this variable are in meters.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.285
A plot of the statistic shows that it's fairly right-skewed,

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.765
with relatively few points above six meters in value.

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.269
It might be worth doing a zoom in of the main bulk

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.804
of the data through the use of axis limits.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:22.030
We can use the matplotlib function xlim to set

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.270
the upper and lower bounds of the bins that will be displayed in the plot.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.879
This function takes an argument, a list,

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.829
or tuple of two values specifying these limits.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.734
In this case, I've set the axis limits from zero to six.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:39.554
I've also changed the bin size in anticipation of this reduced axis limit.

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:41.484
In this case, there's actually not

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:45.304
that much additional illumination provided by the trimmed axis limits.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:48.710
Most Pokemon species are human-sized or smaller,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.670
with relatively few that are much taller than that.
