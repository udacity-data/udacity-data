00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:10.359
Great job. You've taken your first steps in visualizing your data.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.080
In this lesson, you'll learned about the plots and code that you can use to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.835
visualize and understand individual variables in your data set.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.120
For quantitative variables, the most common plot type is

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.964
the histogram and for qualitative variables,

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:26.605
the most common plot type is the bar chart.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.190
You learned about the limitations of pie charts and

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.170
doughnut charts and how they can be used effectively.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.899
You also learned about techniques to help you identify

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.780
trends in the data and deal with outliers.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.425
On the vertical axis,

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.509
you learned how to report frequencies in terms of

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.390
absolute counts or as relative frequencies.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.920
For quantitative data, you also learned how to set parameters in

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.429
your functions to set axis limits and to change the scale of measurements.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.390
The observations you make during

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.710
the univariate stage of exploration will help you start to answer

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.179
your research questions or generate more specific questions for further investigation.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.909
In the next lesson, you will learn how to create bivariate visualizations so you can

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.539
observe the relationships between pairs of variables in your data set. See you there.
