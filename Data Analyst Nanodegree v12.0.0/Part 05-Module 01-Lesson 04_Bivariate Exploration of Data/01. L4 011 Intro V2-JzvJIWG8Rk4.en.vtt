00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.794
In the previous lesson,

00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:09.960
you used Univariate Visualizations or visualizations of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.625
single variables to begin exploring your research questions.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.480
In this lesson, you will continue to develop

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.385
your insights through Bivariate Visualizations.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:23.609
Bivariate Visualizations are those that involve two variables.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.244
We use Bivariate Visualizations to look at relationships.

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:30.120
When we change the level or value of one variable,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.740
what kind of changes do we expect from the second?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.395
Are there consistent patterns or trends?

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:39.275
Are there multiple clusters in which our data points fall?

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:43.159
We will look at three major bivariate plots.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.014
For quantitative versus quantitative variables,

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:47.695
there are scatter plots.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.965
For quantitative versus qualitative,

00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.935
we use violin plots.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.520
And for qualitative versus qualitative,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.260
we discuss clustered bar charts.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:00.729
You will also learn about bivariate plot types to summarize

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.359
your data and how to adapt univariate plots for bivariate data.
