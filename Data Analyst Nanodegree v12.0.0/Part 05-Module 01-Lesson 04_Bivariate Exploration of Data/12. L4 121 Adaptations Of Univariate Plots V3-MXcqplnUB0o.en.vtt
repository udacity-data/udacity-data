00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.440
Besides faceting, there's one other way in which

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.595
univariate plots can be adapted to display bivariate relationships.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.970
In both histograms and bar charts,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.295
we had the frequency of data points on the vertical axis.

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:22.330
If we instead reported the mean of a second variable,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.525
this would make the plots bivariate in nature.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.900
Sometimes, we may add error bars to the plot to show

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.425
the amount of uncertainty we have in the true average.

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:35.860
You might wonder why we would do this for a bar chart when

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.550
a box plot takes the same amount of space and reports more statistics.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.570
As an explanatory data visualization,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.500
the adapted bar chart is a more direct and easier to read summary of your findings,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.585
just as the box plot is more direct than the violin plot.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.790
There are also some cases where a violin or

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.045
box plot is insufficient for depicting the data.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:02.690
Let's say that we have some game data recording the type of strategy

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.515
used by the first player and whether or not they won the game.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:10.385
Since the outcomes can only take a value of one or zero,

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:14.195
a box plot are violin plot doesn't make much sense.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:18.085
Instead, plotting a bar chart with the mean outcome

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:22.595
gives us a quick indication of which strategies are better than others.

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:28.645
Similarly, the adapted histogram acts as a condensed alternative to the scatter plot.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:33.845
However, it is likely that you will see values encoded not in bars and their heights,

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:36.830
but the position of points on a line.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.160
We will talk about these line plots in the next part of the lesson.
