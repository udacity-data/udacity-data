00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.300
One way that you could think about clustered bar chart is that it's really a set of

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.839
side-by-side univariate bar charts on different subsets of the data.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.594
This technique of creating multiple copies of the same type of

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:21.899
plot but for different subsets of the data is called Faceting.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.574
We can use this for any type of plot,

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:26.384
not just for bar charts.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:29.920
A violin plot for example could be thought of as very similar

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.094
to a set of histograms faceted by a categorical variable.

00:00:34.094 --> 00:00:36.254
As a general technique,

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:41.605
faceting is good for breaking down potentially complex patterns into simpler parts.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:46.894
This is especially useful if you have a categorical variable with a lot of levels.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.609
For example, this plot shows user registration dates

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.700
faceted by month and arranged in a three by four grid,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.050
separating things out into multiple bar charts instead of

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.049
a single long bar chart makes it easier to

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.263
see the unusual number of January first registrations.

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:08.640
One thing to be careful of when faceting is that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.950
your axis scales and limits are consistent across each subplot.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.150
A failure to have the same limits on each subplot we'll make it easier to have

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.850
misconceptions about the overall frequency or value range for each subset of the data.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.954
Take for example these two plots.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:30.349
The plot on the left suggests that the two groups have approximately the same frequency

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.750
and range but only if you don't pay attention to the axis ranges.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.989
The plot on the right fixes both subplots to the same axis ranges and clearly

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:42.309
shows that there are more points of type B and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.760
that those points are generally of higher value than A
