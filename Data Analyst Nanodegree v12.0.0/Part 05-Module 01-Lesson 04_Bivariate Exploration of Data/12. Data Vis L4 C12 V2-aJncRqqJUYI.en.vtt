00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.924
One additional option that we have for plotting one quantitative variable

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:08.439
against one qualitative variable is the adaptation of bar charts.

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.910
Instead of showing counts on the vertical axis,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.240
we can show the mean of a second variable.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.030
To do this, we need to make use of

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.244
a different function than the count plot function that we had before.

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:22.125
Instead, Seaborn's bar plot function will be what we want.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.670
I'll add a label to the y-axis so that it's

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.620
clear that we're plotting the means on the y-axis.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.440
Since we have a bar plot,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.759
the bottom limit of the y-axis has been set to zero.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.424
The black lines on each bar indicate uncertainty about the mean as a confidence info.

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:39.614
Since we have a lot of data available,

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.030
the uncertainty whiskers are quite small.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.545
If we want to leave these whiskers out of the plot,

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.899
we can do so by setting errwidth equals zero.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.739
Alternatively, we could change the bars to represent the standard deviation of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.995
data points by setting the parameter ci equals sd.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:58.919
If having the zero lower bound isn't of interest,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.950
then you can choose the point plot function instead of the bar plot function.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.359
We actually don't need to set the base color in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:08.609
this case for everything to show up as the same color.

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.215
Note that by default,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:12.575
the points are connected by a line.

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:17.810
This isn't a problem in this case since vehicle classes ordered from smallest to largest.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.674
But if we were plotting a nominal variable instead,

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:25.200
we could turn off the line by setting line styles to an empty string.
