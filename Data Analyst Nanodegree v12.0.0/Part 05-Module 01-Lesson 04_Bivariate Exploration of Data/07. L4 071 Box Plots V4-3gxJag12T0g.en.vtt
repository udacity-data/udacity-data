00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.950
You saw how violin plots can be used to depict

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.535
the relationship between a quantitative variable and a qualitative variable.

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:16.985
An alternative plot that you might want to use, is the box plot.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:20.705
In a box plot, we compute descriptive statistics within

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:24.965
each level and depict them graphically using a box and whiskers.

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.470
The central line and each box indicates the median of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.730
the data and the upper and lower edges show the first and third quartiles.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.700
Whiskers are extended from the top and bottom of

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.015
the boxes to indicate the largest and smallest values.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:46.680
25 percent of the data falls between each set of horizontal lines.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.030
Box plots often have outliers plotted as points beyond the ends of the whiskers.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.410
The most common upper bound on the length of the whiskers is

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.515
1.5 times the interquartile range or box length.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.810
For the scores posted by North,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.600
the IQR is 5.5 and the maximum whisker length is 8.25.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.675
If we have outliers that are further than this distance

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.920
above the top of the box are below the bottom of the box,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.890
they are depicted as single points and the whiskers are only extended

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.985
to the farthest point within the 1.5 times IQR range.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:28.215
In this case, the maximum bound for the upper whisker is 66.75,

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:31.270
so the maximum value of 68 is depicted as

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.650
an outlier and the whisker is placed at the next largest value of 63.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.300
While box plots do a fine job of summarizing the data,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.940
there are some distributional details that can get lost.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.360
For example, the box plot reveals more clearly than

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.580
the violin plot that the North team had

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.800
the worst performance and the Central team the best.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.950
However, it is not obvious from the box plot that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.385
the South team scores include a broad plateaus between about 60 and 62 points,

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.880
as you can see in the violin plot.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.220
One alternative approach for showing summary statistics is to start with

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.355
a violin plot and then add lines to the curves to denote quartile points.

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:16.975
However, this is a bit less direct than the box plot.

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:20.020
So, when it comes to explanatory data visualization,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.480
you might want to choose a box plot for simplicity and focus.
