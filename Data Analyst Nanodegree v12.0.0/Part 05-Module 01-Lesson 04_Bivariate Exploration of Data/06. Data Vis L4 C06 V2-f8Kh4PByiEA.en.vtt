00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.405
Thus far in the lesson,

00:00:01.405 --> 00:00:04.955
we've only looked at relationships between quantitative variables.

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.700
We'll now look at the relationship between our fuel efficiency

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.435
variable against the qualitative variable, Vehicle class.

00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:15.970
Note here that I've used Pandas as type function to convert the V class column from

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.560
a plain object type into

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.219
an ordered categorical type putting the classes in order of size.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.239
This way, the sorting of levels is automatic and I

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.699
won't need a second order parameter in my visualization calls.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.239
The prototype I'll be going over in this video is the violin plot.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.539
When we use seaborn's violin plot function in

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.979
the usual way setting the data x and y variables,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.229
we get the following plot.

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.505
We should clean this up a little bit first.

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:46.130
I'm going to use the color palette function to make sure each level is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.425
the same color and the Xticks function to slightly rotate the labels.

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:52.359
For now, I'm also going to set

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.890
the inner equals none parameter to clean up the middle of the plots.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.445
I'll get back to this parameter later on.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.554
For each of the vehicle classes,

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:03.229
an area is plotted that shows the approximate density

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.265
of efficiency values for each vehicle class.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.954
They're like density curves turned on their sides.

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:11.159
From this plot, we can see that there isn't

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.744
a monotonic relationship between car size and fuel efficiency.

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:17.740
The largest cars seem to have the lowest fuel efficiencies,

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:21.583
but the longtail suggest outliers with the highest of efficiencies.

00:01:21.584 --> 00:01:24.109
Mini compact and subcompact cars have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.909
the next best efficiencies but

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.094
the distribution for mini compact cars is much more peaked.

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:31.590
Finally, compact and midsize cars have

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920
the best efficiencies but the distribution of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.995
the midsize cars is broader than the compacts.

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:41.390
Let's briefly go back to the plot without the inner equals non parameter setting.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.745
The thing that is plotted in each violin is a miniature box plot.

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:48.740
A box plot is another quantitative versus qualitative

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.799
plot type that takes a summary approach to displaying the data.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.399
I'll give more details about box plots in the next video.
