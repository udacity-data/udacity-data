00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.394
When we looked at the impact of jittering and transparency on scatter plots,

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:13.695
we saw an implied relationship between color, and density of data.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:19.964
There is a bivariate plot type that uses this relationship explicitly, a heatmap.

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:24.574
In a heatmap, the field is divided into a grid of cells like this,

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:28.164
and the number of data points in each cell is counted up.

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:32.259
Each cell is done given a color based on the counter values.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.724
In this example, the more data points in a grid cell, the darker the color.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.295
A heatmap is like a 2D version of a histogram,

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.210
looking at the data from a top-down perspective.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.704
We can't use bar heights in this case,

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:49.585
so color is our next best encoding.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:53.225
Since assigning values based on color is imprecise,

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:57.145
you should consider adding count annotations on top of each grid cell,

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:00.580
especially if you only have a limited number of cells.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.914
In this way, the heatmap is also like a table,

00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:06.950
with additional coloring coding for emphasis.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.820
A heatmap is favored over a scatter plot when you have two discrete variables,

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.139
since the associated jittered scatter plot can already be imprecise.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.370
It's also an alternative to adding transparency to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.965
a scatter plot when you have a very large amount of data.

00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:26.350
However, like histograms, you need to be aware of

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:29.989
the impact of bin size on the interpretation of the data.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.714
Too large a bin size,

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:34.155
and you may fail to see the major trends in the data,

00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:35.995
and with too small a bin size,

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.400
you may end up distracted by noise.
