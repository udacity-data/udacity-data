00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.855
Great work. Now that you've got a handle on bivariate plots,

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:11.330
you will be able to visualize and identify

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.460
the relationships between variables in your data.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.865
Scatter plots show the relationship between two quantitative variables

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:23.954
while clustered bar charts show the relationship between two qualitative variables.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:29.809
You also saw how heat maps could be used as 2D histograms and bar charts.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.479
Violin plots and box plots are the primary plot types used to show

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:39.224
the relationship between one quantitative and one qualitative variable.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:44.859
You also learned additional techniques to adapt univariate plots to bivariate data,

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.500
letting you inspect data at different levels of complexity.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.479
This include faceting multiple univariate plots across subsets of

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.654
a second variable as well as using a second variables mean instead of count.

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:03.945
You also learned about line plots and how they can show changes in value across time.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:07.790
There were a lot of plots we covered in this lesson.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.395
These will form the core of your insights in your data exploration.

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:14.714
Through these bivariate plots,

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:19.060
you can learn how changes in one variable might affect the values in a second,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.605
and identify clusters and patterns in the data.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.990
This in turn will help develop the hypotheses

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:29.634
and expectations surrounding your research questions.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:32.895
In the next lesson, you will learn techniques to introduce

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:37.024
additional variables into your plots to refine your insights.

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:39.570
I hope you're looking forward to it.
