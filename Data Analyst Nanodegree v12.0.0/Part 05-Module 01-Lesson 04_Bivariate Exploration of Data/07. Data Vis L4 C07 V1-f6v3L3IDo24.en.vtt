00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
Last time, we used a violin plot to look at

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.875
the relationship between vehicle class and fuel efficiency.

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:09.449
Now, we'll use box plots to summarize that relationship.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.105
Just substitute violin plot for box plot, and we've got our output.

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:15.820
The bottom of each box,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
indicates the first quartile and the top of each box, the third quartile.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.034
The central line is the median of each group.

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:26.079
Whiskers branch out toward the min and max and each group,

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.164
with outliers depicted as individual points past a maximum whisker length.

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.280
That depends on each group's box height.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.509
The taller each box, the wider the whiskers can be.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:39.034
The box plot supports the observations that we made in the last video,

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:43.959
regarding the relative order and variability in fuel efficiencies by vehicle class.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.969
If we move back to the violin plot,

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.259
now you can understand what was plotted in each violin area.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:52.774
The thicker black region represents the interquartile range,

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:55.989
with the white dot in each violin, the medians.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.420
I actually prefer the inner equals quartile parameters setting.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.795
Which only plots the quartiles as dashed lines.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:06.174
The line with the larger dashes are the medians,

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:10.129
and the lines with the shorter dashes on either side, the quartiles.
