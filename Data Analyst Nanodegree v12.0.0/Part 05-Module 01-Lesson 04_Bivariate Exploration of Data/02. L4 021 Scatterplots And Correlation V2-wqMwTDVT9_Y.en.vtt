00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:10.550
If we are interested in looking at the relationship between two quantitative variables,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.480
the go-to plot type is the scatter plot.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.940
In a scatter plot, the values of one variable are indicated by position on

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.045
the x-axis and values of the other variable are indicated by position on the y-axis.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.800
One point is plotted for every observation we

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.940
have in our data resulting in a cloud of points.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.609
The pattern of points can clearly show what kind of

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.799
relationship exists between our two variables and its strength.

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:40.369
We are often interested in quantifying the strength of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.754
the relationship between two variables through a correlation coefficient.

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:48.945
The most commonly used measure is the Pearson correlation coefficient,

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:53.520
identified by the letter r. A detailed discussion of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.030
this correlation coefficient is best left for

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.969
a different course but a quick overview is worthwhile here.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.159
The statistic takes a value between negative one and one.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.950
Positive numbers indicate relationship where positive changes in

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.909
one variable are associated with positive changes in the second.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.679
While negative numbers indicate that when one variable increases,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.640
the second variable tends to decrease.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.540
Values close to the extremes of negative one or one indicate a stronger,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.755
more predictable relationship while values close to zero indicate a weaker relationship.

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:33.409
The correlation coefficient does not necessarily tell you anything

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.340
about the steepness of a line that models the relationship.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.275
And most importantly,

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:44.340
the Pearson correlation coefficient only captures linear relationships.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.380
As observed with Anscombe's quartet,

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:51.739
we had multiple data sets with the same Pearson correlation coefficient,

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:56.250
but when plotted demonstrated very different shape characteristics.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.840
It is important to consider not just the numbers

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.885
alone but whether or not they are meaningful for your data.

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:07.045
If one of our goals is to create a regression model around the data,

00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:10.650
scale transformations can be useful to change a non-linear trend in

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.830
the natural units into a linear trend in the transformed units.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.665
Let's say that we have a scatter plot like the one shown.

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:21.264
As we increase the value of x,

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:24.839
the spread in the value of y increases drastically.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.610
If we change the scaling of the y variable to a log scale,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.815
then a linear pattern appears.

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:33.914
This informs us that we want to try using the value of

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:37.719
x to predict the log of y in a regression approach.
