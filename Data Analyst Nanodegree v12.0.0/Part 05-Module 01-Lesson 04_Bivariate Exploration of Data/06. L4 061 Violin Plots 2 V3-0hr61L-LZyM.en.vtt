00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.075
As we saw previously,

00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:08.945
when we have two numeric variables,

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:10.644
at least one of them discrete,

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:15.629
jitter and transparency can be used to make the trends in the data clearer.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.039
If we want to plot a quantitative variable against a qualitative variable,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.684
we could take the same approach,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:26.169
just mapping each level of the qualitative variable to an arbitrary number.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.135
For example, let's say that we have a number of game scores from three different teams,

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.820
North, Central, and South.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.424
If we associate one with North, two at Central,

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.669
and three with South, then we could use a jittered scatter plot

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.780
with team on the x-axis and score on the y-axis.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.219
A more common visualization for this quantitative

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.265
versus qualitative comparison is the violin plot.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.265
Instead of plotting data points individually,

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:56.929
we have a curve for each level of

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.704
the categorical variable whose area depicts the distribution of points.

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:03.614
Where the curve is wider,

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:05.490
there are more data points.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.750
It's basically a smooth histogram or density curve turned on its side.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.920
For North, you can see that they scored more points in the 50's than the 60's.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.820
You can also see that Central tends to score more points than either North or South.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.489
Compared to the jittered scatter plot,

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:28.030
having the distinct curves makes it easier to remember that the variable is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.879
categorical and easier to compare their distributions.
