00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.039
If we want to look at the relationship between two categorical variables,

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.658
then we have to go beyond simple positional encodings.

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.410
Earlier in this lesson,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.615
you saw how heat maps depict a 2D histogram across two numeric variables.

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:21.889
A similar strategy can be used for

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.330
two categorical variables analogous to creating a 2D bar chart.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.524
However, if we want to avoid the imprecision of using color to encode numbers,

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:35.284
then the standard plot choice is the clustered bar chart.

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:39.799
A cluster bar chart starts out the same as the univariate bar chart with

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.789
the levels of one variable on the x-axis and counts to be plotted on the y -axis.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.140
However, instead of just one bar being plotted at each x position,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.240
we instead have multiple bars.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.200
One for each level of the second variable we want to plot.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.830
Typically, we apply a color or texture encoding to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.224
each bar in each cluster to distinguish between the levels of the second variable.

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:08.744
Thus, the counts depicted by the height of each bar are associated with

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:13.995
the general X position for the first variable and the color for the second variable.

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:16.810
This correspondence is easier to see when

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
we put the heat map next to the clustered bar chart.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.250
Comparing the two visualizations,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.629
you can see the increased precision and understanding the ranking and

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:30.929
differences in frequency counts when you look at the bar chart compared to the heat map.
