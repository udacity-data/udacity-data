All right, so let's recast this conversation in terms of purity.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.520
Say I have two splits that are available to me.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.390
I can split based on bumpiness or split based on the speed limit.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.940
And then let's say I'm only going to look at one of the halves.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.630
I'm going to look, compare this half to this half.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.360
Which one of these two sets of examples has more purity in terms of

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.280
being all of one class label or the other?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.650
