00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.850
Well, this one's tricky.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.560
X smaller than 3, yes means you're on the left side.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.670
And if you're on the left side,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.330
I would say 2 is a great decision boundary over here.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.550
So, I'm going to go put in 2 over here as a test.
