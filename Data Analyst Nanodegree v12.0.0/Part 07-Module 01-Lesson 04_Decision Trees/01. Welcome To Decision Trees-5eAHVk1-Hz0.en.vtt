00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.719
&gt;&gt; So, welcome to our third, and final, supervised classification algorithm.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:04.280
&gt;&gt; On?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.210
&gt;&gt; Decision trees.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.380
&gt;&gt; Decision trees are one of the oldest and

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.490
most used elements in machine learning in general.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.050
They go back for decades, and they're extremely robust.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.610
&gt;&gt; They have really interesting looking decision boundaries too,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.920
that you'll see as soon we start coding things up.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.520
&gt;&gt; And, they're very intuitive, so you can look at the result and understand it.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.130
It's a great algorithm and we're really excited to get started.
