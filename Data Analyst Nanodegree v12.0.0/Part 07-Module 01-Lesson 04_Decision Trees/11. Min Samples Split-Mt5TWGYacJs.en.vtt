00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.070
Now let's see what this does in code.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.700
So here, I have two decision trees.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.840
One of them is quite complex with lots of intricate little pieces of

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.300
the decision boundary.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.270
The other is much simpler.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.760
It only has maybe two or three major cuts.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.617
And one of these I made with a min_samples_split equals 2,

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:18.819
the default value, and one of them I set it to 50.

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.655
And the question for you is, which one is which?

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:25.403
So, write in the text box either your intuition, or you can code it up and

00:00:25.403 --> 00:00:29.470
actually see for yourself, which one you think has which parameter setting.
