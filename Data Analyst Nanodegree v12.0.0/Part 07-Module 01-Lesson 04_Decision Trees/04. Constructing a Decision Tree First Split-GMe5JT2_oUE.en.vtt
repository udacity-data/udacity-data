00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.190
And I would say it's three, and three is kind of tricky

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.370
because as we split the data over here we see a distinct different

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.450
phenomena on the left set of the data from the right side of the data.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.560
In fact, once we split the data into the left half and the right half

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.600
they become fairly linearly separable, using axis parallel decision lines.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.440
These are lines that run parallel to the axis only look at one

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.270
variable at a time.
