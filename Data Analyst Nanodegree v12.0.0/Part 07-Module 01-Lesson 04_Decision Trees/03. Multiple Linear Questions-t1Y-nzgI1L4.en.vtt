00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.270
Decision trees allow you to ask multiple linear questions, one after another.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.940
So, in essence what you could do is you could first ask the question

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.340
is it windy?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.590
Yes or no.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.890
And by windy we define some sort of a threshold in this access over here.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.180
Let's take this one over here because it's kind of looks the right one.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.890
You can answer with yes or no.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.900
And depending on what the answer is,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.689
you will either go on this branch in the tree or this branch in the tree.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.378
And what this effectively does is it puts a linear decision surface right here

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:37.730
to the diagram.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.670
Now how can you construct this?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.630
In one of the two outcomes, you already know the final class,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.130
which one would you know be done with, and you have the right answer.
