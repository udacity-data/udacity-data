00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.750
And the answer is no.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.920
If it's not windy,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.180
then all the remaining points, they go on this branch over here, our negative.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.490
So you could say for no the answer is a big red x.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.220
In the case of yes however,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.770
we have to ask another question, and this question is whether it's sunny.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.680
There's two outcomes as before yes and no.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.850
With some cleverly selected threshold that I'd say is right over here.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.230
And if you answer this with yes we asked if you answer it with no.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.870
You get the red x.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.860
So this thing over here is called the decision tree.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.741
And what decision tree learning does in machine learning is it

00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:53.136
takes data like that, and finds something like this, that can help you

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:57.920
classify future data using this very simple data structure called the tree.
