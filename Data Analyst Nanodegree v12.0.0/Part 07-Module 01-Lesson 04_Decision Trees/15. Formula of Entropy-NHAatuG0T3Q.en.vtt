00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.520
Entropy has a mathematical formula.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.180
Let me give it to you now.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.260
The formula is -Pi log2(Pi).

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.470
Let's unpack this.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.490
Pi is the fraction of examples that are in a given class, class i.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.480
And then, you sum over all the classes that are available.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.400
In the next few videos,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.790
I'll give you lots of hands on experience with performing entropy calculations.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.880
But first, let me give you just a little bit of intuition.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.870
As you can see from this definition,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.510
entropy is basically the opposite of the purity.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.610
So, in one extreme you can have all the examples be of the same class.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.120
In that case, the entropy will be 0.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.140
In the other extreme,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.480
you can have the examples be evenly split between all the available classes.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.080
In that case,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.154
entropy will take on it's mathematically maximal value which is 1.0.
