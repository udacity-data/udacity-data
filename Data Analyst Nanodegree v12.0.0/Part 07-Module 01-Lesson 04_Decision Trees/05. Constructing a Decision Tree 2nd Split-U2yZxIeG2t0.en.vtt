00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.290
So, let's say there's two outcomes.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.470
Yes and no.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.100
For the left side, I'm now going to ask a Y question.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.960
Is Y smallest in value, and I give you again five choices.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.802
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:15.750
Which one would you pick over here as the decision boundary?
