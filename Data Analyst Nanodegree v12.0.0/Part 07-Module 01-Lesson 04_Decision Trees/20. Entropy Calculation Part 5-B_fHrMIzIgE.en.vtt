00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.030
Let me walk you through this calculation because if you're like me log base two

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.360
numbers aren't something that you can do in your head and

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.622
it can be kind of hard to find a calculator that can handle them.

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:12.640
I'm gonna let Python do the heavy lifting for me.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.510
So I go into Python and I import the math module.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.058
So I want negative Pi times log base two of Pi.

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:31.658
So I do negative Pslow is 0.5 times log 0.5.

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:35.414
If I put the second argument here, the two that tells you the base of

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:38.741
the log to use, so since I need log base two, I put a two there.

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:42.690
If I wanted log base 10, I would put a 10 there, and so on.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.800
And then I need to add in a second term, so

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.270
this takes care of pslow, I also have a contribution from pfast.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.120
Remember, I need to sum over all the classes that are available.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.080
So, Pslow and Pfast happen to be the same.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.160
So this is pretty easy, just type it again.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.317
And the entropy, as it turns out, is 1.0.

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:05.810
So this is the maximally impure state, right.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.780
We have two class labels that are available to us.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.510
And I get an entropy of 1.0.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.270
So remember, the largest that we could get, the largest value for

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.350
the entropy that we could get was 1.0.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.070
This means that, this is the maximally impure sample that we could have.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.110
If we have two class labels, the most impure situation we could

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.090
have is where the examples are evenly split between the two class labels, so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.990
the entropy of the starting node is 1.0
