00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.690
So welcome back to the self driving car.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.760
Katie just asked me to explain to you two terms of machine learning called

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.220
bias and variance.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.870
They are often used as bias - variance dilemma, and, and here's the gist of it.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.309
A high bias machine learning algorithm is one that practically ignores the data.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.610
It has almost no capacity to learn anything, and it is called a bias.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.120
So a biased car would be one that I can train, and

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.730
no matter which way I train it, it doesn't do anything differently.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.270
Now, that's generally a bad idea in machine learning, but you can go to

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.090
the other extreme and make a car that's extremely perceptive to data,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.490
and it can only replicate stuff it's seen before.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.230
That is an extremely high variance algorithm.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.250
And the problem with that is, it'll react very poorly in situations it hasn't

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.260
seen before because it doesn't have the right bias to generalize to new stuff.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200
So, in reality, what you want is something in the middle.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.790
You have what's called a bias-variance trade-off.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.120
You want an algorithm that has some authority to generalize.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.380
But is still very open to listen to the data.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.960
And that's in your choice, very often.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.600
Many algorithms exist, you can actually turn a knob.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.986
And make it more biased, or it can be high variance, and

00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:08.400
the art of, of tilting that knob is the art of making machine learning amazing.
