00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.040
Now that we've gone through that calculation,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.355
let me just point out one little caveat to you.

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:07.560
I'm going back to the scikit-learn documentation, just really quickly.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.900
So, I've gone over to the DecisionTreeClassifier documentation here.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.250
And I see that the splitting criteria that I used,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.900
is actually a tunable parameter for scikit-learn.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
And, in fact, as it happens the default is a metric that's called

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.740
the gini index which is another similar metric of impurity.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.170
You can see that they also support entropy or the information game, but

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.660
this is something that you have to put in by hand.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.890
Either one of these will work probably fine out of the box.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.040
But I did want to mention it to you that in scikit-learn the default is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.260
going to be something slightly different from the entropy.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.120
But both of them should give you reasonably good results.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.410
It's also something that would be interesting to play around with.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.830
So let's head over to Sebastian now.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.680
He's going to talk some about bias and variance.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.340
And what that has to do with decision trees and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.450
all types of supervised classifiers.
