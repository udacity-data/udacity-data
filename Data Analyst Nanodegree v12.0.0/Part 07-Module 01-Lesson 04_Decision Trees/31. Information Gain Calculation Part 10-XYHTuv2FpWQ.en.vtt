00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.020
Last, but certainly not least is going to be the speed limit.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.710
So this time I'll only ask you for the information gain.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.130
You'll have to do the entropy calculations on your own.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.540
What is the information gain when we make a split based on speed limit?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.770
Write your answer in the box.
