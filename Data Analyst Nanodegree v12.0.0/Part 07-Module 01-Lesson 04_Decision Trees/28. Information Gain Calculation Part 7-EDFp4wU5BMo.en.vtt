00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.610
The next variable that we'll look at is bumpiness.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.039
So let's compute the information gain when we make a split based on bumpiness.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.990
So what's the entropy of the bumpy terrain?

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.810
Write your answer in the box as a decimal.
