00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.910
And remember that

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.470
when we started with all the data, the entropy of the parent was 1.0.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.160
Now let's use information gain to decide which variable to use when splitting.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.260
We'll start by doing an information gain calculation for the grade.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.650
So here's my parent node, with all four examples in it.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.960
Now I split based on the grade.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.320
So the first question for

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.950
you is how many examples are going to go in the steep branch?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.930
Write your answer in the box.
