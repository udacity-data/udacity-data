00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.920
I hope you got three.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.370
One, two, three.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.920
And of those three, I see that this one and this one are slow.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.810
So two of them are slow.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.990
And the last one in the list there is fast.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.630
So this is the steep path of my tree.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.950
Then on the other side is my flat terrain.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.010
I only have one example of a flat terrain, and that's fast.
