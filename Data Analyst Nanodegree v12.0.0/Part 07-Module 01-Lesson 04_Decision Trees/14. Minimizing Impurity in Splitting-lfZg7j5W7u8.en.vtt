00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.320
And, as you might've guessed, this is going to be the one that has more purity.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.590
You can see that everything in this set of examples is all

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.850
going to be something that has to go slow.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.630
Whereas, over here, you get some contamination from a few fast points.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.170
And, this is an introduction to the idea of entropy, and the idea of impurity.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.420
What you're trying to do when you build a decision tree is,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.690
is you're trying to find variables and split points along those

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.540
variables that's going to make subsets that are as pure as possible.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.890
And, by repeating that process recursively,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.610
that's how the decision tree actually makes its decisions
