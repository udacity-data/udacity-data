00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.150
Now were going to talk about something that's very important for

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.400
decision trees, and that is entropy.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.120
Entropy is basically the thing that controls how a decision tree

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.030
decides where to split the data.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.270
So, entropy is this very powerful thing.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.050
What's the definition?

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.320
It's a measure of impurity in a bunch of examples.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.590
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.240
Sebastian self-driving car data, we have the grade and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.000
the bumpiness of the terrain, like we did before.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.610
But, let's suppose that there's a new variable, a new feature now

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.413
that we're going to take into account, and that is a speed limit.

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:39.424
Remember, the question was whether the car can drive fast or slow.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:43.190
So, if there's a speed limit, it shouldn't be driving very fast.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.440
So remember, before we had data that looked like this,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.640
where he had the bumpiness and the grade.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.760
Now, let's suppose we had the speed limit and the grade.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.460
And, let's suppose the speed limit worked like this.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.050
If the speed limit was in force, you're in this half of the data.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.800
And the, if the speed limit is not in force,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.930
you can go at whatever the speed you like, you're in this half of the data,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.510
the lower half of the scatter plot here.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.885
So then, when the speed limit is in effect, doesn't matter what grade it is,

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:13.230
everything's going to be slow.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.800
Whereas, when the speed limit is not in effect,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.820
you still have to go slow when it's too steep, but

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.570
now you can still go fast if it's flat enough, if the terrain is good.
