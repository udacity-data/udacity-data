00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.920
And, the answer that I got is that this more complicated one

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.140
has two samples required for splitting.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.380
So basically, it can split until you have a leaf size that's,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.370
that's only one because if you have two samples, the branch and

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.440
then it allows it to split, then you can have one and one.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.980
So, we can get very, very finely tuned.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.690
You might only have one point out here.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.100
And, it's drawing this big peninsula, a big,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.480
narrow peninsula all the way out just to grab that one point.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.560
And then, this one, of course, is going to be a lot simpler.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.520
You have to have at least 50 samples in a branch.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.200
Otherwise, you won't be allowed to fit it.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.890
So, you come up with something that's much simpler.
