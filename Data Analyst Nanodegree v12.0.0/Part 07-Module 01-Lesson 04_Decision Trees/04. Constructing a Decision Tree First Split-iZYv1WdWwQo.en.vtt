00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.080
So, let's practice this using a slightly more complicated example.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.480
Suppose, we have two coordinates, x and y, and here is our data.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.020
So, at the root of a tree, I am going to first ask a question about x, and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.969
I want x to be either smaller or larger than some threshold.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.024
&gt;From these numbers over here, one.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:23.420
two. three. four. five, which do you think is the best threshold to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.660
use in this data set?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.690
Take a look, and give me the the best threshold for

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.671
an x related question between one and five.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.560
. So but, definitely, we are going to build a whole tree,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.830
what is the most useful x language you'd like to split the data?
