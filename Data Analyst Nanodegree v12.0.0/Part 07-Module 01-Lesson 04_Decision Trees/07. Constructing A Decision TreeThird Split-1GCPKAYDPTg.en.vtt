00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.610
I would argue it's roughly 4 in my very deficient drawing here,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.380
because it separates the blue circles and the red crosses.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.930
And again, when I ask the question, is Y smaller than 4,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.330
there are 2 outcomes, yes and no.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.195
For the yes branch, which one do you pick, the red x or the blue circle?

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:24.035
And you picked wisely, it's actually the red x.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:28.360
And that means for the no outcome, where the value is larger or

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.575
equal to 4, we get blue circles.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.320
So this thing here is the decision tree or

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.750
one of the main decision trees that characterize this data.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.790
The algorithm decision tree learning,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.490
is to use a computer algorithm to find the decision boundaries

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.700
automatically based on data, and Katie's going to tell you all about that
