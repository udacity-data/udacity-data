00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to the mini project on decision trees.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.820
In this project we'll be tackling the same project that we've done with our

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.240
last two supervised classification algorithms.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.670
We're trying to understand who wrote an email based on the word

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.200
content of that email.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.730
This time we'll be using a decision tree.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.285
We'll also dig into the features that we use a little bit more.

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:22.790
This'll be a dedicated topic in the latter part of the class.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.720
What features give you the most effective,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.380
the most accurate supervised classification algorithm?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.020
But you'll get a little sneak piece of this in the second part of the lesson.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.830
So get ready to code.
