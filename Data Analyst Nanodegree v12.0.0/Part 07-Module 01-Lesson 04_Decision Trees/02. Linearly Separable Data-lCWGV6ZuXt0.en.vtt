00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.900
So one method in machine learning that's very,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.580
very popular is called decision trees.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.250
And just as in support vector machines, you were able to use a kernel trick,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.920
to change from linear to non-linear decision surfaces.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.457
Decision trees use a trick to let you do non-linear decision making with simple,

00:00:22.457 --> 00:00:24.860
linear decision surfaces.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.978
So let's start with an example.

00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:33.544
I have a friend named Tom, and Tom loves to windsurf.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:36.292
But to enjoy windsurfing, he needs two things.

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:40.395
He needs wind, and he also needs the sun because he

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:45.810
doesn't really like surfing with overcast or in rain.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.981
So, we take all the days of last year and make them data points.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:53.284
He doesn't surf when the weather isn't very sunny.

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:57.500
And he doesn't surf when there's not enough wind.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.988
But when these conditions are met as windy, and it's sunny,

00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:06.480
he enjoys windsurfing on the lake.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.960
My very first question, is this data linearly separable?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.970
Yes or no?
