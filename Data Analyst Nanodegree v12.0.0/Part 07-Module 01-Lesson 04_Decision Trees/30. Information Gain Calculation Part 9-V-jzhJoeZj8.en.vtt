00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.690
On this split, the information gain is actually zero.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.570
We don't learn anything by splitting the train,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.940
these particular training examples based on the bumpiness of the train.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.930
So this clearly is probably not where we want to start splitting our

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.290
sample if we want to build a decision tree.
