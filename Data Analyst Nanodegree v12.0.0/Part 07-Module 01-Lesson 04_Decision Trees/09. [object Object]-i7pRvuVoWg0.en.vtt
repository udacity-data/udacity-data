00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.230
And now, our next quiz, something we always want to ask of our classifiers.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.840
What is the accuracy?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.920
So, in the prompt, write a couple lines of code that will return the accuracy so

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.390
we can compare it to the other classifiers that we've looked at.
