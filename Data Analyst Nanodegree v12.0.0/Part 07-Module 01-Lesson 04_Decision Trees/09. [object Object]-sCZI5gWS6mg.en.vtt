00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.870
Okay. So the accuracy that you should have gotten was 90.8%,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.030
when you run the decision tree out of the box.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.260
But you can also see that there might be some problems with overfitting in this

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.480
particular tree.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.860
Maybe there are some parameters in here that we could be tuning that we

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.330
could try to bump this number up a little bit more.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.330
So let's jump back into the documentation and try to figure out

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.720
what parameters we can tune so that we can get this number a little bit better.
