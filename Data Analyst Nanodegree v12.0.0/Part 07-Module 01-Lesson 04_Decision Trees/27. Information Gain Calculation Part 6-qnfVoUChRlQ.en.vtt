00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.220
So the entropy of the children is going to be

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.850
a weighted average of the two branches.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.550
So I have three quarters of my children going into the steep branch

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.510
with an entropy of 0.9184.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.170
And I have one of my children

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.040
going into the flat branch with an entropy of 0.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.090
That's this number up here, remember.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.850
Remember, this was the entropy that we started out with, 1.0,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.900
it was the most impure system that you can have with two labels.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.080
So the question is,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.730
what's the information gain if I were to split based on grade?

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.060
Write your answer in the box here.
