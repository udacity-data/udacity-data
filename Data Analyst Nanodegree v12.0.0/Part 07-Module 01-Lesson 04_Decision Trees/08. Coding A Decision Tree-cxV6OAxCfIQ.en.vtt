00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.180
So I hope you had some success with your decision tree in scikit-learn. Now let me show you

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.920
the decision tree decision boundary that I got when I tried this problem.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.810
So here's what I got.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.520
And you can immediately see that the decision tree decision boundary is

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.120
very distinctive.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.830
All these jagged little lines.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.290
It almost looks like, you know, a piece of, of modern art or something.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:28.900
It's carving out all these horizontal and vertical cuts that it makes.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.980
Because of the structure of the decision tree where it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.730
running around trying to slice the boundary in such a way that it

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.650
can get as many points as it can in the training set.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.440
You can see that it can also have little islands, just like the SVM did.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.180
And in general, this is the shape that's going to characterize a decision

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.550
tree or a decision tree boundary.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.250
One of the things you might be noticing is that there's some signs of

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.390
overfitting, perhaps in this decision tree that we have these long,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.180
these long slices.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.610
Like this one here and this one here.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.210
Where the decision tree seems to be kind of going out of its way in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.690
an unnatural way.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.900
And I bet that if you plotted the training points instead of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.970
the test points on top of this decision boundary you'd find that

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.960
there's a few blue training points that are maybe out along here,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.150
that are causing the decision boundary to come way out and try to pick those up.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.340
And likewise, for maybe some red points over here.
