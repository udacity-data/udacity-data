00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.060
And the answer of course,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.310
is this one because I only have one sample in this node.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.040
Any of these other guys I can continue to split because they all

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.320
have more than two samples in them.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.490
So I can keep drawing my tree if I liked.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.880
I can continue to keep going.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.540
Maybe to quite some depth.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.280
Until I get a very complicated decision boundary.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.750
So you can see how once it starts to get really deep, really complex,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.810
that's where you start to get some of these decision boundaries that do all

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.460
these complicated things.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130
And probably end up overfitting your data.
