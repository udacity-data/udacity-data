00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.930
So the information gain is going to be 1, that's the entropy that we started

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.700
with, minus three-quarters times 0.9184 minus one-fourth times 0.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.320
So this is just going to be, the answer is 0.3112.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.650
This is the information gain we get if we split based on the grade.
