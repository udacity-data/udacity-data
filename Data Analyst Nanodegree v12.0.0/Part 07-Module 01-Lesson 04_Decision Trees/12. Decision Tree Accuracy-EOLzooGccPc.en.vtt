00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.480
As it turns out, when you compute the accuracy you can actually see that,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.400
that the simpler decision boundary gives you a better result.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.040
You have a 91.2% accuracy with the min_sample_split set to 50.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.020
And then when you allow it to go all the way down to two,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.360
you only get 90.8% accuracy.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.190
So, you can see that it does make a difference,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.370
not just in terms of how the decision boundary looks, but

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.170
actually in terms of the performance of your classifier.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.729
And, this might not look like a huge difference.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.130
But, that's something that we got for free just by tuning a parameter.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.970
And, if you recall, there were a lot of parameters that we had to play around with

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.640
in decision trees.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.920
So, I would encourage you right now or at some point in the future to sort of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.230
go in and play with, around with a lot of those.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860
Get some intuition for what they're controlling and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.070
how they actually change the shape of the decision boundary.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.710
Because in the future, those are going to be the parameters that you're going to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.110
be tuning to get the best performance out of your algorithm
