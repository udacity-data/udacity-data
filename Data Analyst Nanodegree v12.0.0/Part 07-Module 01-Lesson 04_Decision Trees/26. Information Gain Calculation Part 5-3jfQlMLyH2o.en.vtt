00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.050
Remember, the entropy is the sum over all the class labels

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.640
of -P log2 (P).

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.560
So what's the entropy of the children once we make this split?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.330
So I have two class labels that are available to me, the slow and the fast.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.420
We'll start with slow, so Pslow is two-thirds.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.560
So that's what I'm going to put in here.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.060
Negative two-thirds, log base two of two-thirds.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.870
And now we do the calculation for the fast component.

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:50.070
So Pfast is one third, so this -1/3 log2 (1/3)

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.080
Now you do the calculation and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.660
write the decimal value of this expression into the box there.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.060
Remember if you need to do the log base 2 calculation,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.530
one of the things that I found really helpful is the math module in Python.
