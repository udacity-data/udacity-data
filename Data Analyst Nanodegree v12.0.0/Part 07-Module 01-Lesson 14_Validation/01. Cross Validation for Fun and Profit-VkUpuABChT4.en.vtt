00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.930
Welcome to the lesson on cross-validation.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.060
You've been doing validation all along in this class,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.140
so this won't be brand new for you.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.780
But in this lesson,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.910
we'll actually go into some more detail, some more comprehensive algorithms that

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.740
can help you validate your machine learning in a better way.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.860
Remember back to earlier in this class, I gave you an example of

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.830
a machine learning algorithm that actually sells me clothes.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.290
And that was not a made up example.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.700
There's a startup in San Fransisco that does that.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.380
But you can imagine that if you're the person who's in charge of writing that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.260
machine learning algorithm, you don't want to find out if I'm

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.580
going to like a shirt by just mailing it to me.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.880
You want to have some way of assessing whether your algorithm is,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.960
is actually doing what you want it to do, of testing it, of validating it.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.850
So that's what we're going to be talking about in this lesson.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.417
I'll see you in the classroom.
