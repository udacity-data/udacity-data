You want to call fitting on the training features because you

only want to be looking for patterns in the training data right now.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.900
Remember the testing data is only something we're going to be

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.820
using as a tool for validating the steps that we're taking.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.460
So, if we fit our PCA using our testing data,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.860
we're sort of giving ourselves a little bit of an unfair advantage.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.130
We only want to be looking for patterns in the training data right now.
