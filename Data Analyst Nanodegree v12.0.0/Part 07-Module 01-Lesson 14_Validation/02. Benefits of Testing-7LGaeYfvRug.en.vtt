00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.460
Here's a quick quiz reviewing why we use training and testing data.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.540
Check all the answers that apply.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.260
The first option is that using separate training and testing data allows you to

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.120
make an estimate of the performance of your classifier or

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.120
your regression on an independent dataset.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.890
The second option is that having separate training and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.450
testing data serves as a check on overfitting.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.420
The third possibility is that the training testing split is kind of deep and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.590
mysterious, but the experts tell us we should do it, so, that's why we do it.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.680
And the last option is that since it's so important to have as much training

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.890
data as you possibly can, separating your dataset into training and testing data

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.000
helps you maximize the amount of data that's available for training.
