00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.820
The correct answer,

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.660
of course, is that you want to make your predictions using your test dataset,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.010
that's the whole point.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.310
After this PCA transform,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.350
your test dataset is now in the same form as your training dataset.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.800
It's been, it's had the principle components analysis applied to it.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.600
So now you want to feed it into your Support Vector Classifier and

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.650
see what predictions you get.
