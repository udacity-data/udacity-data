00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.029
Here's the next quiz.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.585
What I want to do now is take my principal components and

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:09.320
I want to feed them into my support vector classifier.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.660
I do that using this train command on my svc.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.880
But first, I need to do a transformation.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.170
When I do this pca.fit, I'm only finding the principal components.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.252
I'm not actually transforming my data into the principal

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:22.700
components representation.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.960
That transformation happens via the transform function.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.680
So my question for you is, to which data set should I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.540
apply this transform function, the training features or the testing features?
