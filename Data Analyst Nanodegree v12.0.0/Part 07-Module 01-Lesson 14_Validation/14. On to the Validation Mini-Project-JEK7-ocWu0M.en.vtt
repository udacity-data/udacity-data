00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.630
So we did it.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.840
We came to the end.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.110
&gt;&gt; Great job.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.439
So now you know how to use cross validation to validate your machine

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:08.109
learning algorithm and

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.780
to also pick the parameter tune that's going to work the best for you.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.820
&gt;&gt; So what is next?

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.580
&gt;&gt; Next thing is the project.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.900
We're going to give it a little bit of practice.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.400
Hands on the keyboard.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.420
&gt;&gt; It's really exciting.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.420
Have fun with the project now.
