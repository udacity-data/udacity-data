00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.380
I want to transform my test features now,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.810
just like I did with my training features above.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.960
And remember, since I haven't called pca.fit again,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.540
what this means is I'm going to represent my test data

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.940
now with the principal components that I found on my training data.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.620
This is very important.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.230
If I refit my PCA using my test features at this point,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.270
it's not going to work correctly.
