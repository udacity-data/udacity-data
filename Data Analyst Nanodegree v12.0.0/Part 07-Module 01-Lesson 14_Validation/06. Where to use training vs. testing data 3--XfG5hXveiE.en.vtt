00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.980
So at this point the training of my support vector classifier is done,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.670
including the principle components transformation.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.270
Now I want to move on to testing.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.260
In order to do that, I need to repeat what I did with my training features,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.510
this time with my testing features.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.700
And that means starting with a PCA transform.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.450
Something very important that I'm not doing here,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.270
is refitting my PCA on my test features.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.500
I want to be very consistent between what I've done with the training features,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.020
and what I'll be doing with the testing features here.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.350
So that means using the same principle components that I found in the training

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.050
features and representing my testing features using those principle components.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.380
So that having been said, when I call PCA to a transform,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.500
do I want to be doing it on the training features or on the testing features?
