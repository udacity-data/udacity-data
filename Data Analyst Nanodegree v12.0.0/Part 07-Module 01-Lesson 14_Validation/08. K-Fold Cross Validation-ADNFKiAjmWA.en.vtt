00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.538
Obviously if you want to minimize training time,

00:00:02.538 --> 00:00:04.843
training once is faster than training ten times.

00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:08.520
So it's obviously TRAIN/TEST is, is, is probably the better one to choose.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.420
If you just want to minimize run time,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.907
well in each case you end up picking one machine running algorithm.

00:00:13.907 --> 00:00:16.568
I would then say if you just care about minimize run time,

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:19.673
you might as well get the benefit of 10-fold Cross Validation,

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.960
to have a better assessment of what's going on.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.821
So I would put my cross-mark over here, but

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.300
it's not clear this, either one could be correct.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.500
But if you want to maximize accuracy of your assessment, how good your algorithm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.260
is, you definitely go for the penalty of going into 10-fold Cross Validation.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.650
Take the extra time and you will get a better result.
