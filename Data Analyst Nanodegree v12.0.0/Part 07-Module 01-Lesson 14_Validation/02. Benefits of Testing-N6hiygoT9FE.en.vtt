00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.460
And I would say that the first two answers are probably the ones that

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.620
are the most accurate.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.600
So testing data of course gives you an assessment of the performance of your

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.500
classifier or your regression on an independent data set and

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.200
also helps you prevent overfitting.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.219
The experts do say that you should do this training testing split but

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.390
that's not really the reason why we do it.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.490
We do it because it helps us understand our results better.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.080
And one thing that it definitely doesn't do is maximize the amount of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.320
training data available.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.950
So if you have to hold out 10 or 20% of your data for

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.420
testing, then of course that's not going to be available when training.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.590
And this is one drawback of the training testing split.
