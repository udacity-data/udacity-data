00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.110
Now that you know all about K-fold cross validation for

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.530
validating the performance of your algorithm,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.790
I want to show you a different use of it that I really love.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.170
Remember back to very early in the class we were talking about

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.239
machine learning algorithms like naive bayse support vector machines and

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.640
decision trees and especially the parameters that you have tune for

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.940
these to get the best performance out.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.530
The way we were tuning these parameters was kind of with a guess and

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.610
check method.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.450
But as it turns out this is really clunky.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.025
It takes a long time.

00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:29.025
Nobody likes to do it.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:30.235
It's just the worst.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:32.856
Cross validation can actually help you out here.

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.994
It can automate a lot of that testing.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.452
And pick our the parameter tune that's going to be best.

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:38.960
So let me show you how to do that.
