00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.410
At this point in the class, you've learned a lot about many of

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.189
the different moving pieces that might go into a machine learning analysis.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.840
And I think it's worth taking a step back and explicitly talking about where you

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.184
want to use your training data and where you want to be using your testing data,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.550
because this can be a little bit confusing sometimes.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.650
Suppose that your overall analysis flow looked something like this.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.420
You start off by splitting your overall data into training and testing sets.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.140
Then the next thing that you want to do is apply PCA, so a feature transform.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.990
And then you want to take a few of your leading principle components and

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.090
put them into an SVM, a classification algorithm.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.340
Remember that PCA itself can have a few different commands that you

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.590
might call on it.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.000
So you can call fit on your PCA,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.060
which actually finds the principal components of your data.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.020
But then you also have to call pca.transform.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.690
Which uses this fit that it's found to actually transform the data

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
into the new principal components representation.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.150
Likewise, a support vector machine or

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.270
a support vector classifier can be fit on some of the data and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.630
then be used to make predictions on a different set of data.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.410
So let's suppose that coming out of the training testing split,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.050
we have two different sets of features.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.190
We're only going to look at the features in this quiz.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.210
We have what's called training features and test features.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.170
The first thing you want to do is apply principal components.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.800
Specifically, you want to find the principal components using the fit command.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.190
Do you want to apply the pca.fit to the training features or

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.320
to the testing features?
