00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.390
The final project for

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.200
this class is building a supervised classification algorithm that can tell,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.150
based on our Enron data set, who at Enron was a suspected person of

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.518
interest in the fraud case that happened when the company went bankrupt.

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:17.050
In this mini-project, you're actually going to build your first iteration of

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.430
this person of interest identifier.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.270
So, the first thing will be building a, a sort of minimum viable product.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.820
We're not expecting it to be really great,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.100
we're not expecting it to be really optimized, but you'll have something up and

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.250
running in the first part of this mini-project.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.619
In the second part of the mini-project,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.180
we're going to wrap this in a training testing framework.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.080
So that from this point forward, when you go in and you compute the accuracy of

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.270
your person of interest identifier, you have it all set up properly so

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.750
that it's, it's computing that accuracy on the test set like it should be.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.570
And then from this point forward, once you have this code set up, your job is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.620
just going to be then to fill in all the features that you want to use or

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.930
do any transforms, things like that.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.350
So, let's get started on building that code framework.
