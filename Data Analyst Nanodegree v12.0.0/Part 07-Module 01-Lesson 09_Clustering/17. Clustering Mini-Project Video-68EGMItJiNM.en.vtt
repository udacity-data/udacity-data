00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.450
Welcome to the mini project on k-means clustering.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.000
You know a lot about k-means clustering at this point, but

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.480
it's been all on sort of made up datasets for pedagogical purposes.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.870
Now you're going to be doing k-means clustering on real data,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.840
in this case, the Enron finance data.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.250
And as we sometimes do in the second part of the mini project, we're going to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.610
give you a sneak peak at the next lesson, which is on feature scaling.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.760
Feature scaling is some pre-processing that you can do on your features, and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.260
it will actually change the output of your clustering algorithm after you've

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.180
performed feature scaling.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.630
So you'll get an idea of what's at stake when you do something like that
