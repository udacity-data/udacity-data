00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.724
This is a very important thing to understand when starting to work with branches.

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:09.330
If content is stored on one branch and their commits on another branch,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.365
those other commits are invisible until we switch to that other branch.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:16.379
When we switch, then we'll see those commits.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.369
But the original commits will no longer appear in our code editor.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.570
They aren't lost. They're just not displaying since we've checked out a different branch.
