00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Let's start at the beginning,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.094
because it's a very good place to start.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.246
We've got a project with some files,

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:08.689
and we add these files together and make a commit,

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:10.500
and it has this SHA.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.839
Now let's give ourselves a bit more room by

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.564
shrinking this down and displaying just the first letter.

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:17.910
Great, so we have this one commit.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.585
Now let's make a few more changes to the project and commit them.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.914
Awesome. So let's say that the most recent commit

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.000
that starts with the f is where our project is at version 1.0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.859
How would we indicate this in git?

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.149
We don't want to write this in the commit message.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.234
Perhaps we can list this in the body of the commit message,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.000
but that's not ideal either.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.270
We can use a tag to indicate this.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.650
Tags let you point out particular commits to make them stand out from others,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.314
and we can label the tag with something like v1.0.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:51.454
Let's add another commit. See how the tag stays locked to a commit?

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:53.225
Let's give ourselves a bit more room.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:57.480
A tag stays locked to a commit even as more commits are added to the repository.
