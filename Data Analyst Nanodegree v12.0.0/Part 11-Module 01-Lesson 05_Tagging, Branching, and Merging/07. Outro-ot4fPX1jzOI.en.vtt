00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.575
Branches, merges, and merge conflicts.

00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:06.515
Wow, this lesson had a ton of useful information in it.

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:10.129
Branches let us work in isolation from the rest of the project.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.280
Then after you're finished,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.219
you can use Git to merge your branches together.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.109
Now, it doesn't happen all the time,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.730
but if there's a merge conflict,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.179
just pop open your editor and search for the merge conflict indicators.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.501
Remove the lines with the indicators,

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:25.530
figure out what lines you're going to keep,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.510
save the file, stage the file,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.179
and then commit. Easy-peasy.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.500
Congratulations, you are now a Git master.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.939
But if you'd like to learn one last skill,

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.519
check out the next lesson where we look at editing,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000
undoing, and erasing commits.
