00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.616
Now that you're a pro at making commits,

00:00:02.616 --> 00:00:04.714
it's time to level up again.

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:07.049
This leveling-up is going to be an awesome step that

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.824
will really give you version control superpowers.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:12.509
In this lesson, we'll look at git tag,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.545
git branch, git checkout and git merge.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.525
With git tag, you'll be able to add tags to specific commits.

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:24.734
A tag is an extra label for a commit that can indicate useful information,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:27.059
like, this is the beta release.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.219
With git branch, you'll be able to create

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.649
branches that let you develop different features of

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.810
your project in parallel without getting

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.990
confused as to which commits belong to which feature.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.809
That might sound a bit confusing,

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:40.844
just hang on, and we'll cover it in detail.

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:45.725
With git checkout, you'll be able to switch between different branches and tags.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:47.895
Git merge is amazingly helpful,

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.740
because you can use it to take changes on

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.234
different branches and combine them together automatically.

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:55.539
It's an incredibly powerful feature.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.719
The commands we're covering in this lesson will help keep

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.664
your project organized and speed up development.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's start things out with the easiest command, git tag.
