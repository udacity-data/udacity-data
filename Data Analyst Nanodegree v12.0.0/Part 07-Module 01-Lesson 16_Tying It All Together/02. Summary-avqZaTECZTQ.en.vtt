00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.280
In summary, we had four different major blocks of techniques.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.130
&gt;&gt; You start with the data set or the question that inspires you.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.850
You try to extract the information from it, in the form of, of features.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.100
You feed those features into a machine learning algorithm,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.360
this is the heart of machine learning.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.190
And then you evaluate that entire process to see how good you've done.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.750
One of the hardest things is actually coming with the data set or

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.480
the question that interests you.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.010
So one example that I loved was the Enron data set.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.510
For you, this will be something different.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.770
&gt;&gt; We spent a lot of time in class on features, how to present features, how to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.740
get rid of features, how to find new feature spaces that actually work better,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.090
and you can apply these techniques to pretty much any data set to get

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.290
really reasonable feature sets.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.220
The heart and soul of this class were the algorithms which is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.770
where the most fun is in machine learning.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.952
You know that they are supervised if you have labels,

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:51.150
unsupervised if you don't have labels.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.210
There are actually more classes in machine learning that you can talk about, but

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.070
for the sake of this class, this is what we taught you.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.980
And really important is each algorithm needs to be tuned.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.830
We talked about quite a bit how to tune your algorithms.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.140
&gt;&gt; Last but not least will be the evaluation.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.090
How well are you doing?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.650
There's different types of evaluation metrics that you can use.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.700
Depends on, depending on what's most important to you.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.630
And at this point, once you've worked your way through from beginning to end,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.490
the evaluation metric will tell you if you want to go back and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800
revisit any of these steps.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.360
Or if you're happy with your results and you're ready to move on.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.720
&gt;&gt; And the cool thing is this is the entire class on one slide.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.340
Isn't that amazing?
