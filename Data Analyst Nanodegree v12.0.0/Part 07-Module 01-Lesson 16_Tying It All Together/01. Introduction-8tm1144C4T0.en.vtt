00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.510
So Katie, you look a little bit fatigued at this point.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.570
&gt;&gt; We've done an awful lot.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.330
Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many lessons?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.876
&gt;&gt; About to start the 15th, so.

00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:08.622
&gt;&gt; Oh, my god.

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:11.250
&gt;&gt; But I wouldn't say that there's 15 totally separate topics.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.340
I'd say that there's maybe more like four main topics.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.390
&gt;&gt; Okay, what are they?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.400
The first one is the data set and question.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.670
If you want to use machine learning, can you define a question and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.390
find the data could help you answer it?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.240
&gt;&gt; I guess the second one is feature selection,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.260
finding the right feature spaces for your machine learning algorithm to apply?

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.090
&gt;&gt; Once you have the features, do you have an algorithm that you can use, and

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.030
the parameter chains you want for that algorithm?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.160
&gt;&gt; And finally the fourth step is validation.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.270
Make sure what you've got is actually trustworthy.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.050
&gt;&gt; And of course, these steps, you won't just hit each of them once.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.890
But you'll cycle through them repeatedly as you start to figure out a little bit

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.280
more about each individual question,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.510
you learn more, and you do a little bit better.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.877
&gt;&gt; So in this last and final unit, in this last and

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:49.326
final unit, you put the big picture together.

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:53.006
We're going to go up to a higher altitude and learn big picture composition of

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.529
machine learning, so you actually apply these techniques in practice.

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:58.789
&gt;&gt; So let's head up to that higher level.
