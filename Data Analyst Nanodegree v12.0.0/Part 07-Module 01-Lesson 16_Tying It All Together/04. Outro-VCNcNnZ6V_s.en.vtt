00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.240
Guys, that's it.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.050
It's the sad moment that where we're reaching the end of the class.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.190
&gt;&gt; It's been a pleasure for us to teach this class for you.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.550
I hope you had as good of a time learning as we've had teaching.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.078
And we're really excited to see you again either working here in Silicon Valley

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:17.352
as a machine learner or the awesome projects that you're going to go and do.

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:20.380
And hopefully, you post them online and we can see them there.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.460
&gt;&gt; And it's, every time we reach this point in class,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.870
I'm really sad because it's been such a great experience to have you in class.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.390
Fun too, I have, see, Katie do most of the work.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.200
But, but, but you brought something, right?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.070
&gt;&gt; I did. I did.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.630
I was inspired by our conversation during the intro video about winemaking.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.370
So after that, here we go, I actually made my own wine.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.940
&gt;&gt; Your own wine?

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.580
&gt;&gt; My own wine.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.970
This is the first bottle of it that we've opened.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.334
We'll see how good it is.

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:49.832
I'm sure it's not as good as the stuff I'll eventually be making but,

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.944
you know, there's a first time for everything, so shall we?

00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:53.969
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:59.040
It's pretty good.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.540
&gt;&gt; Surprisingly drinkable actually.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.260
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.570
&gt;&gt; So it's been a pleasure teaching you and we hope to see you again soon.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740
&gt;&gt; And don't forget, there's many more courses on Udacity of course,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.510
but there's also really great jobs here in Silicon Valley.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.830
Machine learning people are in very short demand,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.820
and Udacity's standing by to help you develop your career.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.700
&gt;&gt; So we'll see you again soon.
