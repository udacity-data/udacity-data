Great job. I hope that this course and the case study

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.650
helped your understanding of techniques in data visualization.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.970
Knowing the best visualizations to create and the best way to convey the data,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.214
will be a big boost to the speed and quality of your analysis.

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:18.420
These techniques will also make you a better

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.929
consumer of visualizations created by others.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.699
I encourage you to continue to practice the skills that you've learned here.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.950
The more you do, the better you'll be at this vital aspect of the analysis process.
