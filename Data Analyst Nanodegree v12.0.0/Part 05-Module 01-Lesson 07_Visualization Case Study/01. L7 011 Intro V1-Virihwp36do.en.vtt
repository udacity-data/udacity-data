In this course, you've learned about techniques

in exploratory and explanatory analysis.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.540
Here, you will practice the skills you've learned in

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.449
a case study involving the price of diamonds.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.089
You will use visualizations to explore factors

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.984
Then you will polish key plots that tell a story
