00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.474
And here would I use discrete, even though it might look continuous, they have

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:10.140
100 people with 100 order numbers, because there isn't really an order here.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.560
The person who joined as number 56 is in nowhere related,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.231
usually, to the person who joined as number 57.

00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:20.090
And if this order doesn't exist, a discrete classifier tends to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.340
be better even though you might be dealing with numbers.
