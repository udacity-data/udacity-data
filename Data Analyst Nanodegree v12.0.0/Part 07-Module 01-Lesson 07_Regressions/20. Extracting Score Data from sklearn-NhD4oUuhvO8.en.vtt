00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.530
Now that we've talked about the slope and

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.030
intercept, I'm going to go back to these few lines.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.400
What I'm doing here is printing out some performance metrics on both my

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.190
test data set and also my training data set just for a point of comparison.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.110
Remember the test data set actually provides the numbers that we're

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.700
going to trust.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.800
Let me go back over here.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.450
In the next few videos we'll be talking pretty exhaustively about

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.170
the performance metrics that you can use to evaluate your regressions.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.120
But let me give you a sneak preview here.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.650
One performance metric that we'll talk about is something called r-squared.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.335
And to make a long story short, the higher your r-squared is, the better.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.100
R-squared has a maximum value of one.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.480
So what we can do is we can ask for

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.630
this regression that we've made, how good is our r-squared.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.390
And we want to be asking that question of our test data set.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.940
If we ask it of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.110
our training dating set we'll also get some interesting information, but

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.980
only by using the test data set can we be sensitive to things like over-fitting.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.900
So when I go over here and I look at the values of my r-squared score for

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.710
my test data set, and then also my training data set for comparison,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.360
I get a little bit of information about how well my regression is performing.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.404
I said the maximum value is 1.0.

00:01:04.404 --> 00:01:07.260
The maximum value for r-squared is 1.0.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.238
So since I'm getting 0.81 on the test data set and

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:14.220
0.87 on the training data set, I'm actually not doing too badly.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.190
So rather than talking about r-squared anymore, let's go back to the tablet and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.299
we'll talk some more about the types of errors that you can have on regressions.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.930
And how you can quantify them.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.900
So you really understand what these numbers mean.
