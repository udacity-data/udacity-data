00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.720
And again we're picking the top line.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.120
The value of b is the y-value when x is zero.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.990
So when x is zero, this thing over here is the value of b.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.790
And is the largest for the top graph.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.236
And is actually negative for the bottom curve.

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:24.110
So this is slope and intercept.
