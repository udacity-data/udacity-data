00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.260
In every alley the speed is miles per hour is the best.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.610
Obviously fast medium slow is still discrete.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.340
It's not binary.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.920
It's not three choices but it's still discrete.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.710
Angle of the steering wheel is continuous but

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.490
it's not really a good generalization to fast or slow.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.170
But of course speed in miles per hour or kilometer per

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.150
hours is a good generalization of fast slow into the continuous space.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.650
In fact, I would argue speed is always continuous and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.820
our choice to make it binary was an artificial choice to make it fit for

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.410
specific machine learning algorithms.
