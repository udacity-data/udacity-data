00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.960
I know the question was a bit ambiguous,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.220
but if you draw a best line through the data points, I would

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.800
say these things over here are the two boxes that best represent the line.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.630
Obviously, not those two over here,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.450
because that is not a good approximation of the data.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.900
Neither are those over here.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.540
Neither are those over here.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.860
So, I wanted you to click on those two points over here.
