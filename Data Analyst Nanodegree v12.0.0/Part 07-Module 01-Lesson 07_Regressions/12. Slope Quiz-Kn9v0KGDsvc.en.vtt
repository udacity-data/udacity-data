00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.500
Say we have a situation with an input space x and an output space y.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.870
And our linear function is m times x plus b,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.300
where m is the slope and b is the intercept.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.720
I will give you three graphs of intercept zero.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.300
And I wonder for which one is m the largest?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.400
Which one has the largest slope.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.280
Pick one of the three.
