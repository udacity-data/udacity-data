00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.560
So we learned a lot about regression.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.270
In all the examples we saw so far, there was exactly one input variable.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.040
For example, we learned a function that predicted the net worth based on age.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.790
One input, one output.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.230
Now, there's a form of regression where it can have many different input

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.760
variables, IQ, your age and maybe your education.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.210
And those jointly can predict the net worth of a person.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.050
There's a name for this.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.860
This is called multi-variate regression.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.710
It's not an intuitive name, but that's what it's called.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.660
So let me give you an example in which the net worth is the function of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.650
two variables, x1 equals age, and x2 is the IQ.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.508
And we have certain age levels, 20, 40, and 60 here, and

00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:47.822
certain IQ levels, say, 80, 100, and 120.

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:49.339
And in this example,

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.520
I'm going to fill out all the nine combinations of these input variables.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.170
In this example, I'm going to give you nine data points corresponding to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.110
the nine combinations of these numbers over here.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.250
And your task is it, by hand, by sheer thinking,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.020
to figure out the formula that explains this data.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.490
So we have y, and y is the net worth, is some

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.200
number that you will tell me times x1, which is the age, plus some other number,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.080
times x2, which is the IQ, plus potentially a third number.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080
It's a challenging question, but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.600
can you figure out what numbers to put in here, here, and here?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.720
And as a hint, work horizontally first, then work vertically, and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.090
the other numbers should just fall into place.
