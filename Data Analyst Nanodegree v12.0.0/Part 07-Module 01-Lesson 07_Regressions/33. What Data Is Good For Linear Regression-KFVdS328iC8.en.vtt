00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.300
Another reason that visualizing can be very helpful is there's

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.870
some data that just isn't going to be very good.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.020
There's just going to be some data that's going to be difficult to fit

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.220
with a regression.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.290
Let me show you what I mean with a quiz.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.420
Here are a few different data sets I might have.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.610
And I'm making a scatter plot of some features of each one.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.390
And my question for you is, which of these data sets would you look at it and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
say, that looks like a good candidate for linear regression?

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.119
We've done a lot of examples of linear regression, and by a good candidate,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.270
I mean you can write an equation y equals mx plus b

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.280
that does a good job of describing the patterns in the data.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.650
Place a check box by all the ones that would be good candidates.
