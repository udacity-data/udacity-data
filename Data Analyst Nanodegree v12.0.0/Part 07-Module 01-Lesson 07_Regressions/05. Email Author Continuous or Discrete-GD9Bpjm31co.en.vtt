Suppose you want to classify which person wrote an email.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.270
On the other side are now 100 people in your organization.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.250

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.940
I don't know, an id equals 1 to 100 depending on when they're drawn.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.630
So the first person has number 1.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.059
And the last person is number 100.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.600
Is this is continuous, or discrete?
