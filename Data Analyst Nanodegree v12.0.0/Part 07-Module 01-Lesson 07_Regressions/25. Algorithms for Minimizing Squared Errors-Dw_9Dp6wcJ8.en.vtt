00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.900
There's several algorithms that help you find this.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.130
We won't go into great detail of the implementation of any of them.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.470
But just so you know what they're called.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.149
The two most popular are Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.090
And this is what the linear regression algorithm in sklearn uses.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.980
And another popular one is Gradient Descent.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580
We won't go into any more detail on that one in this class, but

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.760
I want you to at least know that it's out there in case you see that term.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.130
That it's a way of minimizing the sum of the squared errors in a regression.
