00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.640
So just to practice a little bit more, I'm going to give you a second example.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.080
You're trying to predict the price of a house.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.890
Again, assume two input features, the size of the house and

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.110
the age of the house.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.790
The house could be brand new, or older, perhaps all the way up to 40 years.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.629
And the size in square feet might be 500, 1,000, or 1,500.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:25.020
And obviously any value in between those numbers makes sense in regression.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.620
But for the sake of this exercise I want to assume these exact numbers that I

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.600
graphed over here.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.450
Further, I want to call size X1 and age X2, and the house price is called Y.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.735
So, my result would be of the type Y equals some number

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:44.890
times x1 plus some other number times x2 plus some constant.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.240
So let me fill in the numbers, and this example is also a little bit

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.340
contrived in that you can get an exact answer for those coefficients.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.460
But, try to do it in your head.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.430
And see how far you get.
