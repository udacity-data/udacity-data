00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.430
A very good question you might be asking at this point is how to

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.960
evaluate your linear regression.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.650
One of the obvious things that you can do is visualize the regression on top of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.340
your scatter points.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.070
Another thing you can do is you can look at the errors that your

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.390
linear regression makes.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.340
By errors, I don't mean mistakes, not exactly.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.170
What I mean by errors is something like this.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.150
Suppose I have my age and net worth data.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.040
And it will be following along in some pattern, although not perfectly linear.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.836
I fit my line to it.

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.909
And this fit is going to have associated errors.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.750
In this context, errors is a technical term and that's the difference in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.630
this example between the actual net worth of a particular person and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.650
the net worth that's predicted by our regression line.
