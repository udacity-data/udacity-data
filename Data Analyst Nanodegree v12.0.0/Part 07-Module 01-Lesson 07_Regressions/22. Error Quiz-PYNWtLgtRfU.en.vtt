00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.390
Let me give you an example.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.230
Suppose we want to look at this point right here.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.310
We'll say the age of this person is 35 years old.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:16.391
So using our formula, their predicted net worth is 6.25 times 35, or about 219.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.140
But let's suppose their actual net worth is actually 200.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.080
What's the error for this point?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.690
Write your answer in the box and be sure to be careful about minus signs.
