00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.810
There are a couple of answers that I think you could make arguments for, for

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.250
what might be the correct answer for this quiz.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.890
One of the things you might say is that the right one is doing a better job

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.060
because it's fitting so many more data points, that it's easier to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.770
describe the pattern in the data, because you just have more data and so

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.670
you're a little bit more certain that, for example, if you kept collecting data,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.760
something weird wouldn't happen that would mess up your fit.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.570
So that's one argument you could make.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.970
Another argument you could make,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.800
which I think is perfectly valid, is that they're about the same.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.479
That, considering how much data you have for

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.010
each one, each one's doing a pretty reasonable job of fitting.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.230
And look, the data's pretty comparable between the two of them.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.100
It's just that the one on the right happens to have more data.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.020
But then if the trend continued on the left,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.730
then you would probably have the same fit.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.270
The point is though that there isn't a huge difference between these two fits.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.970
That they're both generally describing the patterns and the data appropriately.
