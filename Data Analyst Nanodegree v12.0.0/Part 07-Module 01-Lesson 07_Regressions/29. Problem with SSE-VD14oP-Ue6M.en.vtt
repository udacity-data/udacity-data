00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.280
Now here's another quiz.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.650
Which one of these two fits has a larger sum of squared errors?

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.570
Remember, a larger sum of squared errors usually gets interpreted as

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.290
being a worse fit.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.130
So, give it some thought and tell me what you think.
