00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.019
I would say the middle line is probably giving you the best regression result,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.340
because it's kind of equally balancing out the points on either side.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.150
However, in all of these cases you have roughly as many points above the line

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.780
as below the line.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.740
It's just that the one in the middle happens to be the one that's the most in

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.510
the middle so to speak.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.810
If we were talking about SVMs, we might say it has a large margin.
