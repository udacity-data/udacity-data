What if you had this magic classifier where you toss in the name and

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.350
out comes the phone number of the person.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.870
Would you if you were to train something like that say in fact I would

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.260
say the NSA has training algorithms to train something like that.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.280
Because people have multiple phone numbers and

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.470
there's often typos in phone numbers.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.920
Suppose you, you, your job was to, to find the phone number of a person.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.110
Is this continuous or discrete?
