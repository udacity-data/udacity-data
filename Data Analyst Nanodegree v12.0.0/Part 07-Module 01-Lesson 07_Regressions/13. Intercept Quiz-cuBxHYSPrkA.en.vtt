00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.890
Asking the same question about the intercept, I'm going to give you three lines

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.980
with equivalent slopes, say this one, this one, and this one, and

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.080
I want you to tell me which one has the largest b, or the largest intercept.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.210
Pick one of the three please
