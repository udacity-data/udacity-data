00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.790
So this next section is about continuous supervised learning.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.170
And as always we start with a little quiz.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.550
In learning so far we had an input dimension and an output dimension.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.460
And one of them was constraint, not to take arbitrary values

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.450
but what we call, discrete or often binary values like zero, one or fast or slow.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.580
Which of the two axis was it?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.890
I give you two choices, input or output.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.100
So check the appropriate radio box.
