00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.610
So this is actually a surprisingly challenging question if you've never done

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.230
this before.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.270
So let me dissect it for you first.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.364
I'm going to only look at the very first feed over here and

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.311
ask how much does Y grow as you vary X.

00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:18.680
And you can see as we add 20 to X, from 20 to 40, or another 20 to X.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.010
Every time, x1 goes by 20, y goes by 100.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.470
So the factor that goes in over here is y divided by x.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.060
It is a five.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.159
I hope you got that right.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.890
As we do the same thing for the x2 variable, we find when x2 goes by 20.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.020
Y only goes up by 50.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.359
So we divide 50 by 20 and divide, at 2.5.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.049
Now if we left it at this and believe this is the formula and

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.231
this number of here doesn't exist then what we will predict for

00:00:54.231 --> 00:01:00.717
this value over here is 20 times 5 plus 80 times 2.5 and that is 300.

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:02.000
So we get 200 too large.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.769
So we have to subtract minus 200.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.280
And it turns out, the way I made this table,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.970
this is actually the correct equation.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.150
So you can check any value in this table over here and you'll find that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.620
this specific linear equation exactly explains the value over here.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.730
Now that's an artifact.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.520
In reality we don't have such nice situation, where a,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.220
what we call a linear hyperplane explains data so well.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.740
But it gives you a sense that the predictor variable, in this case,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.439
net worth, could be a factor of more than one input variable and

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.950
that is called multi-variate regression.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.690
And all you have to know about this,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.930
there's a piece of software that just does it for you.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.430
So you can actually plug data like this into a table and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.620
out comes the correct result.
