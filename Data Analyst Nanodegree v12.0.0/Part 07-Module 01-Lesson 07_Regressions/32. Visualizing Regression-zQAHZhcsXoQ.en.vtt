00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.080
Of course there's one more thing that I should always be doing when I'm

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.200
practicing machine learning.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.480
And that we've neglected so far which is visualizing our results so

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.260
let me do that right now.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.660
So what I do here, I make a scatter plot of all my data points and

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.225
then I also write a line like this.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:18.340
plt.plot is going to draw a line.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.660
The x values of some of the points along the line will be the ages.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
And the y values will be the predictions for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.950
the ages that are given to me by the regression.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.060
So these are kind of like the features and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.750
the predictions and then this is just some formatting information.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.340
Then I apply some labels and I show it.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520
And I use the show command to see it and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.630
it gives me a picture that looks like this.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.800
Where these are all the points that we had just like before, and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.180
now I've overlayed them with this blue line.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.170
And just by eye you can tell the regression isn't doing anything crazy.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.380
Always a good sanity check is just to look at the results of your regression.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.500
Especially if it's a one dimensional regression like this where you only have

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.820
one input variable, like the ages.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.420
Then it's very straightforward to just look at it by eye and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.360
see how things are going.
