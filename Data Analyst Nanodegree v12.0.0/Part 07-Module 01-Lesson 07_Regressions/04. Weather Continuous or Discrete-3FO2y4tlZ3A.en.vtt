00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.710
I'd say the way I articulated sunny vs. rainy, it's actually discrete, but

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.080
in reality, weather is a continuous phenomenon, it turns out.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.230
So, if you, articulated weather as the amount of light that hits a given

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.370
area on the ground in a given period of time, that's a continuous measurement.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.800
So, you can actually really measure weather continuous effect, I would

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.660
argue that most things we consider discrete are actually somewhat continuous.
