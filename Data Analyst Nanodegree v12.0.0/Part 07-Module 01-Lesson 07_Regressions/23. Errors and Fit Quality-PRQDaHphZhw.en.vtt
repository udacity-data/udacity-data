00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.730
So, here's a quiz.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.940
It's a little bit tricky, so think carefully.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.740
The question is, what's a good criterion for a good fit?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.240
What's something that a good fit will minimize about the errors?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.470
Is it the error on the first and the last data points?

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.030
Is it the sum of the errors on all data points?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.580
Is it the sum of the absolute value of the errors on all data points?

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.850
And, the last choice is the sum of the error squared on all data points.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.670
This is tricky, because you can make a good argument for each one of these.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.589
So, I want you to select the ones that you think

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.640
would have the very best chance of giving you a good fit to the data.
