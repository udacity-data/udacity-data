00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.050
Here's a quiz to help you understand why minimizing the sum of

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.340
squared errors is the best way to think about a regression.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.600
So, here I've given you some data and my warm up question for

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.490
you is what regression line looks best for this data?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.700
Just using sort of your intuitive heuristic for what best might mean.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.530
I'll give you three options.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.610
They're all pretty close together, so just give me your best guess.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.940
Would you say it's the top one, the middle one, or the bottom one?
