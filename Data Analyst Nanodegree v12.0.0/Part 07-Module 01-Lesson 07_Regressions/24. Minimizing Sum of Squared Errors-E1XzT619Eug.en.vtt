00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.800
When you perform a linear regression,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.500
what you are doing is minimizing the sum of the squared errors.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.310
What this means is that the best regression is the one that minimizes the sum of

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.450
the squared errors, and in this expression, I put the equation for the errors.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.360
Where the actual values come from the training points, and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.650
the predictions come from the equation that you get from your regression.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.970
So, the name of game in linear regression is finding the m and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.659
the b that minimize this quantity.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.250
Once you find that m and b, that slope and that intercept, you're done.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.280
You found the regression result that you want.
