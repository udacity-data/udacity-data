00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.840
According to our formula, the error for this person is negative 18.75,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.760
that's the difference between the actual net worth and the predicted net worth.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.660
Another way to think about that visually, is it's this distance right here,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.190
that this point on the line gives you the predicted value, this point right

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.150
here is the actual value and the distance between the two is the error.
