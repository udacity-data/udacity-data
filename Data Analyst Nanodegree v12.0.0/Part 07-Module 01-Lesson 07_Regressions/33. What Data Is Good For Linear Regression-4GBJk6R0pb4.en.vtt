00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.980
This is a tricky question, and

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.700
maybe one that you had to think about pretty hard.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.210
I would say there's only one answer.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.110
This one.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.750
One data set.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.960
It would be a good candidate for linear regression.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.330
Hopefully, you got that one.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.400
So, what are the problems with the other ones?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.290
Well, let's start with this one on the lower right.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.560
It would be pretty easy to think of a function that might fit it nicely, but

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.490
this function would be something like Y equals X squared,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.970
which is not of the form y equals mx plus b.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.430
In other words, this isn't a line.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.396
This is more of a curve.

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.810
There are ways that you can fit these functions, but

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.170
it wouldn't be an example of linear regression.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.390
So that's why this would not be a good candidate for linear regression.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.230
One possibility that's almost good for linear regression is this one.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.960
Because you could fit it with lines but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.970
you need two different lines to fit the pattern adequately.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.780
In fact, if you try to fit this whole data set with one line,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.850
it'll probably give you something like this.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.330
A clever thing that you could do would be to split it in half along this dotted

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.880
line and fit one half of the data to one line and one half to the other one.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.110
So if you checked that box because you're thinking something like that,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530
then I would say that's probably an acceptable answer.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.120
But just as it is, there's not a single line that fits all of these data points.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.850
So I would say that without doing something like, fitting it piece wise,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.870
this would not be a good candidate either.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.370
Next, let's see the data set in the top middle here.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.070
The problem here is just that the data is all over the place.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.530
There doesn't seem to be a very strong pattern.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.310
So there's lots of different lines that might all have very similar r squares or

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.030
sum of square errors that could all look very different.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.860
And in this case, it's hard to say that any of these lines is really

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.120
describing a pattern in the data very well.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.750
So I would say this is not a particularly good candidate.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.110
And this last one, on the upper left, is very tricky.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.350
And if you got this one wrong, you shouldn't feel too bad because it's tough.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.630
And the problem with this one is,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.880
let's look back at this equation y equals mx plus b.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.010
And what this means is that by varying along the x axis,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.090
the input variable, I want to be able to predict something about

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.199
what the y value will be along the vertical scale.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.900
So I only have one x value, and that's right here.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.050
And I have many different y values all along this range.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.690
And so there's no way just using this data.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.840
That I can vary x and use that to predict a change in y.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.600
Another way to say this is that when the equation tries to fit this data,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.080
it's going to come up with infinity for m.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.070
And usually when you get infinities, it means that something's going wrong.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.220
This is very tricky because you definitely need to have variation in x.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.270
Now in this case, of course, on the lower left, you only have variation in x.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.470
You don't have any variation in y.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.100
So in this case, the slope m would be equal to zero.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.510
So fitting it with a line might be a little bit of overkill.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.960
You could just say that, suppose that this is eight.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.860
You could just say that y is always equal to eight.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.180
And that would do a perfectly good job of describing the pattern.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.840
But it's very important that you have a range of x values that you can examine.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.390
So that's why this is not a good candidate for linear regression, but this is.
