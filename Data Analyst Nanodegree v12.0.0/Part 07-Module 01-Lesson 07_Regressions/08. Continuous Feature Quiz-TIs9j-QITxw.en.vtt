00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.950
So let's talk a little example here.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.150
You might remember the Terrain classification problem.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.710
Classification's often meant to be a discrete output.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.670
In our situation we had two output variables, fast or slow.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330
And as it generalizes to a continuous output.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.370
Tell me which one you think is the best generalization here.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.260
Is it fast, medium, slow?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.320
Is there something like the speed in miles per hour, or

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.000
perhaps the angle of the steering wheel?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.900
Just pick one of the three.
