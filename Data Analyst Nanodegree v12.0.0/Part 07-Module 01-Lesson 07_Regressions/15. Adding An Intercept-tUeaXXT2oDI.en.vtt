00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:02.710
And I'd say it's now 255.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.300
Before, 6.25 times 36 equals 225.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.730
And we're now adding 30 and we get 255.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.270
And as you can see, with this continuous machine learning example, called a Regression.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.060
You can make continuous predictions for any age in between.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.130
And you get a meaningful answer that differs continuously with the variation of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.810
the input parameter.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.710
That's not possible in discrete classifications.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.060
In fact if you were to draw a discrete classification into here,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.790
it might look very much like this where for

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.620
an entire range of the input space the output stays the same
