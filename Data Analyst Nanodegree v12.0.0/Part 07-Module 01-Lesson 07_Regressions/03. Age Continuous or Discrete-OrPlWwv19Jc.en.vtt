00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.270
So in practice when you apply a machine learning algorithm, you have

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.840
this distinction between continuous output with discrete output, but it's a bit

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.390
more subtle, and I'm going to give you some examples that are a bit surprising.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.420
Suppose you want to predict the age of somebody,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.360
would you use a continuous classifier or a discrete classifier?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.260
We'll say age is encoded a couple of number of seconds after they're born
