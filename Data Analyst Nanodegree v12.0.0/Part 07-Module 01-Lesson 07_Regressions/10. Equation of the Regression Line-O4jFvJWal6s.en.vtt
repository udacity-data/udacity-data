00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.380
The right answer over here is 6.25 times age plus 0.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.170
It's zero because we are.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.160
When age is zero,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.060
the net worth is zero that means that we are crossing through the origin.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.899
And when you divide 500 by 80 you actually get 6.25.
