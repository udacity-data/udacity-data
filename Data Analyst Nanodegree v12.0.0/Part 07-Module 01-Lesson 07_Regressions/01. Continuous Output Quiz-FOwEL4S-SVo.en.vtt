00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.160
And the quick answer is output, in that we are allowed to

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.310
have arbitrary input values, but the outputs tend to be binary.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.640
For example, slow and fast.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.670
Now this kind of output is called discrete, but

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.263
in many learning problems, your output could be continues as well.

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:20.520
So for example, if the input is the height of a person, and you put it output is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.590
the weight, then what you find is probably a function like this.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.890
It says that the taller a person, the more a person weights.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.290
And in this case the output is not a binary concept like, light or heavy.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.470
It's a continuous concept, and the output itself is also continuous.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.140
So this is what we call continuous supervised learning
