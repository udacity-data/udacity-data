00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.960
There's one important problem with using the sum of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.040
the squared error to evaluate your regression.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.780
I'll show it to you now.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.540
Here are two different data sets, and the regression line for each one of them.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.280
And here's a quiz question.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.490
Which one of these regressions is doing a better job of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.790
fitting the patterns in the data?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.820
They're two slightly different data sets, but you can still make a comparison,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.580
but they're not so different you couldn't compare them, at least by eye.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.920
So do you think the one on the left is doing a better job of fitting the data,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.140
the one on the right is doing a better job of fitting the data,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.920
or would you say they're probably about the same?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.440
I haven't defined what better means very precisely here and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350
I've kind of done that on purpose and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.220
this is going to get to the heart of why sum of squared errors isn't perfect.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.160
So this is a little bit of a tricky quiz, but just give it your best shot.
