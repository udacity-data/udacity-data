00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.880
Welcome to the mini-project on regressions.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.540
If you worked at Enron in 2000 or

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.820
2001, chances are you're getting a pretty hefty bonus.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.620
How hefty? Well that's what we're going to to figure out in this lesson using

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.130
the power of regressions.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.490
So, if you know someone's salary, if you know someone's stock options,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.830
et cetera, et cetera,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.680
are you able to predict how much money they're making in their bonus every year.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.120
And the answer is, well, maybe, but you have to use a regression to find out.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.700
So that's what we'll be doing.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.620
In the second part of the mini project, we're going to get a sneak peek at

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.689
next lesson's material, which is about outliers.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.620
Outliers are data points that fall far outside the pattern as a large, and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.590
you'll get an idea of, of how those actually affect the result that you get

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.120
on something like your regression.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.550
It can be bigger than you might think.
