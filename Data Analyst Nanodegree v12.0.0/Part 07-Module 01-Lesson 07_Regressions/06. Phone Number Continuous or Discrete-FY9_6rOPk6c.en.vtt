00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.900
And again I would say it's discrete.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.705
In a sense that, phone numbers, they have a bit of an order.

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:08.340
The, in the United States, the area codes are similar for

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.410
people in the same region.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.660
And there's a chance that people with the same name live in the same region,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.620
because people marry and exchange names.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.950
But by and large, the phone number of this type, 024-3111 and 024-3112.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.020
There isn't really any relationship.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.780
They're not nearby.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.000
There's no real ordering in phone numbers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.480
So, as a result, you're better off with a discrete classifier than continuous
