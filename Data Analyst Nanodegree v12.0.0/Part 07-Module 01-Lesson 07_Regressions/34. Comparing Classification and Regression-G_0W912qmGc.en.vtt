00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.540
Here's a quick comparison between classification and regression.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.290
We'll go into more detail in everything that I write here.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.029
But I want to give you a quick overview just so

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.690
you know what to look out for in this lesson.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.780
So the first thing I'll mention is the output type of the algorithm.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.870
As you know, for supervised classification,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.530
this is going to be discrete in the form of class labels.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.010
For regression this is continuous.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.320
Which basically means that you'll be predicting a number using a regression.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.150
The next question, a very important question is what are you actually trying to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.340
find when you perform a classification or a regression?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.130
In the case of classification this is usually a decision boundary.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.790
And then depending on where a point follows relative to

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.680
that decision boundary you can assign it a class label.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.600
With a regression what we're trying to find is something we usually call

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.220
a best fit line.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.660
Which is a line that fits the data rather than a boundary that describes it.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410
This will make a lot more sense in the next couple of videos.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.160
The last thing I'll mention is how to evaluate.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.890
When we were doing supervised classification we usually use the accuracy,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.190
which is whether it got the class labels correct or not on your test set.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.740
And for regression we'll talk about a couple different evaluation metrics.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.400
One of which is called the sum of a squared error.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.320
Another one is called r squared.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.750
I'll tell you a lot more about both of these in the middle part of the lesson.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.470
The main point I want you to take away from this is that,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.090
while regression isn't exactly the same as supervised classification.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.990
A lot of the things you already know about supervised classification have direct

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.690
analogs in regression.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.350
So you should think of regression as a different type of supervised learning.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.280
Not as a completely new topic that you now have to learn from scratch.
