00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.010
So here's the solution to this quiz in case you had any problems.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.190
The first thing you have to do is import the SK learn regression module.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.110
Of course it isn't quite this simple because it's called sklearn.linearmodel,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.850
but you can figure this out from the documentation pretty easily.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.480
There's a familiar linear regression function, and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.550
I have my regression which I named reg.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.190
Reg gets, linear regression, and

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.030
then I don't have to worry about parameters in this particular case, and

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.400
then the next thing to do is just to fit it the same as we did a classifier.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.640
We do this of course on our training data, and of course now we have this

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.190
regression its been, trained on our training data and we're just returning it.
