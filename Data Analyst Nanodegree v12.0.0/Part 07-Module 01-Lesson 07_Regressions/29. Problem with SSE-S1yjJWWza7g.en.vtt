00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.510
In this case, the distribution on the right is going to have the larger sum of

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.060
squared errors, and it should be fairly straightforward to see why.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.130
You can compare point by point, these would be all the errors on the left.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.990
There's very similar sum of squared errors on the right for these data points.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.660
But, then on the right, you have all these additional data points.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.850
And each one of those is going to contribute a little bit of error

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.420
that we'll add to the overall sum of squared errors of the fit here.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.660
So what that means is that the distribution on the right has a larger sum of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.650
squared errors even though we agreed that it's probably not

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.130
doing a much worse job of fitting the data than the distribution on the left.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.840
And this is one of the shortcomings of the sum of squared error in

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.530
general as an evaluation metric.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.950
Is that as you add more data the sum of the squared error will almost certainly

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.310
go up, but it doesn't necessarily mean that your fit is doing a worse job.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.250
However, if your comparing two sets of data that have different number of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.460
points in them then this can be a big problem, because if your using the sum of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.630
square errors to figure out which one is being fit better.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.360
Then the sum of squared errors can be jerked around by the number of data

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.040
points that you're using, even though the fit might be perfectly fine.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.770
So this motivates me to tell you about one other evaluation metric that's very

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.910
popular when evaluating regressions.
