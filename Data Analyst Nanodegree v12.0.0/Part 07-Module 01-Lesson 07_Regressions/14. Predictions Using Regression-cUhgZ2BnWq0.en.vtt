00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.153
So, coming back to our example of age versus net worth, and

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:12.898
say my machine learning algorithm determined that my target function

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:19.090
is net worth, written as y, equals 6.25 times age plus 0.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.580
Suppose you meet a person whose age is 36.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.840
What do you think our machine learning algorithm would

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.340
say his net worth y is going to be?
