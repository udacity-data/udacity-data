00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.940
So let's do a little example here just to get a feel for

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.160
what you can do in continuous output spaces with machine learning.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.870
It's a contrived example, but suppose we graph all the people in the world and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.170
record their age and their net worth.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.270
If you don't know what net worth is, this is kind of the total money that you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.340
kind of own, both in cash, and houses, and cars, and so on.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.850
And just for the sake of the argument,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.970
let me assume there aren't quite seven billion people, and the relationship

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.940
between net worth and age looks about like this.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.770
In reality, that's often not the case.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.870
But let's assume that's the case here.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.000
I now want you to fit an imaginary line through the data and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.030
pick two of the points I'm kind of marking here,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.520
as two representative points to which the line would go.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.060
Just click on two of those points that best represent the line,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.310
that best describes the data.
