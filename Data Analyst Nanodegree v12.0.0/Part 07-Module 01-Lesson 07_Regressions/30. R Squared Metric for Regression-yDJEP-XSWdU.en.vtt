00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.629
An evaluation metric that doesn't have this shortcoming is called r squared, and

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.651
is a very popular evaluation metric for

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:09.546
describing the goodness of fit of a linear regression.

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:14.958
And, what r squared is, is it's a number that effectively answers the question,

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.694
how much of my change in the output is explained by the change in my input?

00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:24.830
And, the values that r squared can take on, will be between 0 and 1.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.810
If the number is very small, that generally means that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.350
your regression line isn't doing a good job of capturing the trend in the data.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.120
On the other hand, if r squared is large, close to 1, what that means is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.720
your regression line is doing a good job of describing the relationship

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.420
between your input, or your x variable, and your output, or your y variable.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.330
And, remember, this is the whole point of performing a regression,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.040
is to come up with a mathematical formula that describes this relationship.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.270
So, if your r square is close to 1,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.740
it basically means your fit is doing a good job.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.060
The good thing about r squared,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.920
is that it's independent of the number of training points.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.500
So, it'll always be between 0 and 1.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.860
In general, it's not affected by the number of points in your data set.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.920
So, this is a little bit more reliable than a sum of squared errors.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.030
Especially, if the number of points in the data set could

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.330
potentially be changing.
