00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.440
Now this is the way to write, in general, a result of a supervised learner.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.110
On the left side is our target variable, the one you are trying to predict,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.900
often called the output.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.470
And on the right side, age, is our input variable.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.050
Two other words here, this fact over here, 6.25 is also called the slope.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.670
And this number over here, which happens to be zero, is called the intercept.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.730
Since they define how steep this curve goes up, 6.25.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.310
And where this, of course, intercepts the vertical axis over here.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.030
Let's see if it can help us understand slope and intercept in the next quiz.
