00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.860
So to solve this, we do the same trick as before.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.550
And again I lined it up at the number so

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.340
correctly, it's not as easy to do real regression.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.660
But, you're going to find that as we increase our size by 500 feet

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.670
from 500 to 1000, or 1000 to 1500, the price also increases by 500.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.060
So that means the ratio of price increased to size increases one.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.990
And that goes in over here.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.880
So go vertical, we find that if we increase the age by 20 years,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.490
our price drops by minus 200.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.755
So that means the ratio of those minus 200 that's divided by 20 is minus 10.,

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.970
It's really important to get the minus sign right,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.390
because older houses are cheaper in this spreadsheet.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.530
And eventually as we try and find the y intercept so to speak.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.440
Or put differently the constant over here.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.010
We plug in those two constants over here on the left data point.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.860
500 times one would be 500.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.670
Zero times minus ten is zero.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
So we would with these two coefficients only we get a 500 over here.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.240
If we need to get all the way to 1,000, so we have to add 500 to it.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.750
And that's the correct result.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.430
Okay once again this is a multivariate regression.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.570
It happens to be an exact fit.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.580
If you get into situations where these numbers don't exactly fit,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.510
you have to apply a much more complicated formula.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.490
You can't just look at the data over here and data over here.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.180
You have to look at all the data, but

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.490
explaining the detailed formula to you is a bit outside the scope of this class.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.680
But what you will do is, we'll use the existing software

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.780
to calculate results for situations just like this
