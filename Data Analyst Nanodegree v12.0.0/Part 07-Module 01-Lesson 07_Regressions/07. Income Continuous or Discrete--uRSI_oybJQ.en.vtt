00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.330
And here I'd say it's continuous.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.860
Because making $10,000 is just about the same as 9,999 or

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.940
making 20 bucks is about the same as 19.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.010
So there's an order here.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.630
So what I'm trying to drive home is that when we

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.730
make it continuous really implies that there's some sort of an ordering to it.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.570
So we find that there's many different outcomes and they fall into linear order

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.070
where you can make greater or equal decisions, go continuous.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.665
If there's many outcomes and

00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:33.310
they even occur by numbers without an order, then you go discrete.
