00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.360
Welcome to the lesson on feature scaling.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.380
Feature scaling is an important step in pre-processing your features for

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.790
some types of machine learning algorithms.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.350
We'll talk a little bit later in this lesson exactly where you need to use it.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.170
Let me start out by giving you some intuition for what it accomplishes and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.540
what can go wrong when you don't do feature scaling.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.760
So let's suppose I have a buddy Chris and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.630
Chris wants to know what size T-shirt he should wear.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.530
For some reason he doesn't know his t-shirt size but he does know two good

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.210
friends Cameron and Sarah and they each know their t-shirt sizes.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.230
Chris can than get some data from Cameron and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.500
Sarah about say how tall they are and how much they weigh.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.560
And based on this information Chris can tell what size t-shirt he should be

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.060
wearing based on whether he is closer in size to Cameron or to Sarah.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.250
So here are some numbers to make this more concrete.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.260
Chris is tall and very skinny.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.140
He weighs 140 pounds and he's 6.1 feet tall.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.680
Cameron is also fairly tall, but not quite so skinny.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.351
He clocks in at a 175 pounds and 5.9 feet.

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.940
And Sarah's pretty petite.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.209
She's 115 pounds and 5.2 feet tall.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.270
Cameron of course wears a size large T-shirt, Sarah wears a size small, and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.110
we'll assume for

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.960
the sake of argument that there's no such thing as a medium in this example.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.860
So my first question for you is just your intuition.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.530
Should Chris wear a large like Cameron or

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.500
a small like Sarah, based on his height and his weight?
