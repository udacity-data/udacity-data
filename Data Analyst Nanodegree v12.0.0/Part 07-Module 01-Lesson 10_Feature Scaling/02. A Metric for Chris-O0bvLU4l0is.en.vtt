00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.980
Now let's suppose you're a computer who's trying to answer this question.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.150
And you don't have any particular knowledge about what height and weight are.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.720
But you can compute numbers pretty easily.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.430
And the metric that you'll use is the height plus the weight.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.800
Whoever Chris is closer to in the height plus weight metric,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.540
that's the size that he'll wear.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.020
So the first question is, what is the height plus weight for Chris.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.520
Height should be measured in feet and weight in pounds.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.750
Write your answer in the box.
