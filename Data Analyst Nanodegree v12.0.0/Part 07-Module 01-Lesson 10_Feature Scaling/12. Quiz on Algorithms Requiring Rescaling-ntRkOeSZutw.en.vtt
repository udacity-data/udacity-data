Okay, Katie, you did a fantastic job telling people about feature rescaling.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.620
And now when I put your knowledge to a test,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.430
to see which algorithm you believe is susceptible and

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.350
impacted by rescaling features, and which ones are somewhat not impacted.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.180
So here is a set of algorithms.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.010
So which algorithm would be affected by feature rescaling?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.110
Here's a set of algorithms.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.050
That you know very well.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.720
Decision trees, support vector machines, say with a RBF kernel.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.740
You might remember linear regression.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.550
And I'm going to toss in k-means clustering.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.440
It's a pretty non-trivial question.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.580
Some of those will give you the same result even if you rescale the features,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.460
and some of them will have substantially different results.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.570
So check the ones that would be effected.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.241
Where the results really depend on the feature rescaling.
