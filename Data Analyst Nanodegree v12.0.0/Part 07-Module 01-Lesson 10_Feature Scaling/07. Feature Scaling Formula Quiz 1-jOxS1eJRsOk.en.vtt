00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.600
One of the nice things about feature scaling is that it's

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.940
fairly straightforward.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.810
There's a formula, and you just have to apply it to your data.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.970
Here's the formula.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.260
x prime is the new feature that you're making.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.220
And you use information about the old features to figure out

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.960
what value it should take.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.111
x min and x max are the minimum and

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:22.020
maximum values that are taken by the old feature before it was rescaled.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.050
And x is the old value of the individual feature that you're rescaling.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.090
So just to make this more concrete, let me give you a quiz.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.430
Suppose the old weights, the feature that we want to rescale, are 115,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.540
140 and 175 pounds.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.260
If this is the old feature, what is x min?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.400
Write your answer in the box.
