00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.495
Welcome to the mini-project on feature scaling.

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:06.890
In the mini-project on K-means clustering, you clustered the data points.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.130
And then at the end, we sort of gestured towards feature scaling as

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.778
something that could change the output of that clustering algorithm.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:17.050
In this mini-project, you'll actually deploy the feature scaling yourself.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.700
So you'll take the code from the K-means clustering algorithm and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.640
add in the feature scaling.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.590
And then in doing so,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.370
you'll be recreating the steps that we took to make those new clusters.
