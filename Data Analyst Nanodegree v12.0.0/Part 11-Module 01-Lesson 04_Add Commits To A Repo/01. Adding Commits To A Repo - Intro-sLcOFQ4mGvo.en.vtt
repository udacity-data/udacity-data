00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
This is the lesson where we finally learn how to make commits of our very own.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.374
Are you excited? Because I am.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:10.974
We've laid the groundwork of learning the git init command to create a new repository,

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:14.309
the git clone command to copy an existing repository,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.054
the git log command to review existing commits,

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:21.644
and the all important git status command to see the status of the repository.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:25.245
As a side note, remember to have a download sheet with all the terms handy

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.550
during this lesson since we'll be using almost every term on that sheet.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.859
So we have these as the foundation we'll

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.798
build on top of them in this lesson with git add,

00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:37.213
git commit, and git diff.

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:42.104
With git add, you'll add files from the working directory to the staging index.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:45.089
With git commit, you'll take files from the staging index and save

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.515
them in the repository which is what actually makes a commit.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.000
The git diff command is really cool and will seem pretty

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
familiar actually since you've already seen its output before.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.655
git diff displays the difference between two versions of a file.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:00.719
Its output is exactly like the output of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.379
the git log dash p command we used in the previous lesson.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.989
So we've got a couple of new commands and one that's going to be very familiar.

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:10.979
Now before we can use the commit or diff commands we have to

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.020
learn how to use git add. So let's get cracking.
