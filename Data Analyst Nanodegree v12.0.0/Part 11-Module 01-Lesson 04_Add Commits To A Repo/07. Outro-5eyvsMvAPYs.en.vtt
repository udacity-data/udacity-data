00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
We just covered a ton of information in this lesson.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.120
We looked at using git add to stage content.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.144
We used git commit to actually commit changes to the repository.

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:13.324
We also looked at what makes a good commit message.

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:15.809
Then we learned about how helpful git diff can

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.054
be to help us recall changes that haven't been committed yet.

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:21.210
And last, we just looked at the git ignore

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.185
file to tell git what files it should not track.

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:26.849
You now know how to create or clone a repo,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.500
how to make professional commits with

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.344
clear descriptive commit messages and then how to review existing commits.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:38.344
With this knowledge, you can jump in and start working on any git repository.

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.579
One powerful concept, we'll look at in the next lesson is branching.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.284
Branching let's you work on a project in multiple different states

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:49.209
and it will take your git skills to the next level. Let's go check it out.
