00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.290
Just using what you know from

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.905
the bivariate case of comparing two variables in the last lesson,

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:12.350
you probably know more than you think about multiple linear regression models.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.259
It's essentially the same as with using only one explanatory variable.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.935
Except that when you interpret your coefficients,

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:24.224
you'll add the statement of holding all other variables constant.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.190
So what exactly does this mean?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.214
Well, if you were to interpret

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:31.364
this coefficient attached to the square footage of the house,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:35.685
we would say for each additional unit increase in the area of the house,

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:37.850
the price is expected to increase by

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.079
345.9 as long as all the other variables stay the same.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.879
So assuming that these houses both have one bathroom, one bedroom,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.574
but one house has one square foot more than the other,

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:55.750
we would expect its price to be 345.9 higher.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.210
This interpretation which is almost exactly the same in the earlier lesson,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.785
is what you would do for

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:06.375
every quantitative variable in our multiple linear regression model.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.049
Additionally, a quick glance at the P values can provide

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.390
some context for whether or not we think

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.560
a variable is statistically related to the response.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.768
This isn't the only check you should do,

00:01:17.768 --> 00:01:22.760
but it's a great quick check to understand which relationships appear to be important.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.755
Two points for further exploration come from these exercises.

00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:30.479
First, notice that even though looking at the relationship between

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.490
only the number of bathrooms and

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:35.884
the price showed a statistically significant relationship.

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:37.905
When we added this to looking at

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.519
all the variables at once, this relationship disappeared.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.950
There are few reasons why this might have happened.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.570
And we'll explore those in the next concept.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.339
Second, when adding quantitative variables to our model,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.075
it worked just like you saw in the last lesson.

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:55.370
But what about with categorical variables?

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.245
When we tried to add them everything broke.

00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:01.620
So let's explore these two findings a little bit more.
