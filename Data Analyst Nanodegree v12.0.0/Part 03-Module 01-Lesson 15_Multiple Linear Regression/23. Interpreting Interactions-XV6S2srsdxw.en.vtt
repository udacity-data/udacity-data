00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.560
Each time you add these higher order or interaction terms to

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.759
the model you should be sure to add each of the lower order terms as well.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.140
We saw how you might be able to identify a quadratic like relationship and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.600
even higher order terms might be useful when we see

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.890
many curves in the relationship between the response and explanatory variables.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.130
But, how do you know if you should add an interaction term?

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.484
Why would we add something that looks like this into our model?

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.730
Let's consider a small example to illustrate this idea.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.710
When adding interaction terms,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.640
you're considering it the way that a variable X1 is related to your response Y,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.070
is dependent on another variable X2.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.009
As an example, consider

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.570
that for neighborhood A the relationship between the square footage of a house and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.259
its price looks like this and for neighborhood B

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:55.849
the relationship between the square footage of a house and the price looks like this.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.609
Here, you can see that the slopes of the lines that

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.850
best fit each set of points are the same,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.763
even though this neighborhood has more expensive homes for the same square footage

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:08.030
this would be accounted for by

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.135
the dummy variable as this space between the two lines is consistent.

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:15.770
And regardless of the neighborhood the increase would be the exact

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:19.569
same accounted for by this coefficient here in our model.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.804
However, imagine if the relationship actually looked like this for neighborhood B.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.635
Here, we can see that the slopes of these two lines

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.935
no longer match in order to account for this,

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.200
we would want to add an interaction term between

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.545
neighborhood and square footage to our model like this.

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:39.140
Here, you can see that the way square footage is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.379
related to the home price is dependent on which neighborhood

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:49.119
the home is in or the way the X1 is related to Y is dependent on the value of X2.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.620
So the question of adding an interaction is a question

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.454
about these slopes being close enough to equal.

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:56.569
If the slopes are close to equal,

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.524
then we don't add an interaction.

00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:01.520
However, if these slopes are not equal this

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:04.509
is an indication that we should add an interaction to our
