00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
This lesson had a lot of information.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.620
A quick recap of the different topics is provided in the text on the next concept.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.234
Understanding multiple linear regression in terms of applications,

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:14.414
potential problems, and how to assess model fit,

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.829
is at the heart of more complex machine learning methods.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.250
In this lesson, you looked at how you could use

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.039
regression to predict quantitative response variables.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.849
In the next lesson you'll do the same,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.679
but for response variables that are categorical.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.019
See you in the next lesson, on logistic regression.
