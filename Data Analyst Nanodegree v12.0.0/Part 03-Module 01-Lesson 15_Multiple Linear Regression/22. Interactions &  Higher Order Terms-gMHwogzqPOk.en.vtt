00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Sometimes, we would like to fit models where

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.615
the response is not linearly related to the explanatory variable.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.914
We can do this with what are known as higher order terms.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:12.704
Higher order terms include quadratics,

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.875
cubics, interactions, and many other relationships.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.859
In order to add these terms to our linear models,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.074
we can simply multiply our columns by one another.

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:26.984
Here, we can create a quadratic relationship for the number of bedrooms,

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.039
by either squaring all the values in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.079
the bedrooms column or by multiplying the column by itself.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.684
Let's store this in bedrooms squared.

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.340
When we add these higher order terms into our models,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.005
we also need to include the lower order terms.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.810
Let's try predicting the price using bedrooms and bedrooms squared.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.189
We're going to create our intercept again.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:58.754
We need to predict our response which is the price.

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.745
We're going to do this using bedrooms, using intercepts.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:11.060
Here, we can take a look at the results.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.870
Notice, that adding the quadratic means that we can not interpret

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.990
this coefficient attached to the bedrooms the same way that we could earlier.

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:22.649
That is, this coefficient isn't

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.205
the predicted change in price for each additional bedroom any longer,

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:31.900
because changing the bedroom and this term also means changing it in the quadratic term.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.165
So the change in price is dependent on the starting and ending number of bedrooms.

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:38.850
The change in price for changing from

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:43.140
three to four bedrooms isn't the same as changing from five to six bedrooms.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.575
So neither of these terms is easily interpreted.

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:50.170
We could also add a cubic term to our dataset, like this.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.935
Here, I'm going to call this bedrooms cubed.

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:55.820
And then, we might add it to our model like this.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.659
Just steal this part,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.409
and then we have this cubed portion.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.259
So I'm just going to add that, here.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.270
So then we can look at our results.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:09.174
Here, you can see that the R-squared actually increased by a little bit.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:14.710
However, that's not a very substantial amount for including this cube number of bedrooms.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.659
It's probably not appropriate to think that

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.949
the cubed value of the bedrooms is actually associated with the price,

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.034
but we'll discuss this more later.

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:29.109
Additionally, each of these coefficients down here isn't interpreted in a nice way.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.330
Let's now look at an interaction term.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.015
An interaction term is created by multiplying

00:02:34.014 --> 00:02:37.614
two variables by one another to add to your linear model.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:41.935
Let's create an interaction between the area and the number of bedrooms.

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:45.215
We'll add this into our data frame for this dataset.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.650
Now, to add the interaction terms to our model,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.855
we should again add the lower order terms.

00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:54.864
This means adding both the area and the bedrooms into our linear model.

00:02:54.865 --> 00:02:57.860
Since the number of bedrooms is already in our model,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.500
I'm just going to add the area as well as the interaction term.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.715
Great. So here, you can see there's a substantial improvement.

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:07.330
In the next video, you'll get a closer look

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.000
at how we know we should add one of these terms.
