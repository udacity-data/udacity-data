00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
You actually are very well equipped to take on fitting

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.310
multiple linear regression models as well as interpreting the results from these models.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.314
Let's take a look at an example.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:10.740
This is a similar dataset,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.789
the housing dataset you saw in the last lesson which is available in the resources,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.234
and in the next concept for you to follow along.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.119
Here, I've written the appropriate libraries as well as the dataset.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.163
Now, to fit our linear model,

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:25.140
let's first create an intercept.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.535
Then, we can again use stats models similar to what you did in the last lesson.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:34.490
But we'll need to add all of our variables into the list for the X portion.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.164
So here we're adding the intercept,

00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:40.079
and we're interested in predicting the price.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.945
And on the right-hand side here,

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:46.755
we need to add all of our variables that are quantitative.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.638
If you try to add the categorical variables,

00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:50.570
you'll notice that that breaks.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.740
Store that in LM for a linear model.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.987
We will fit the model.

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:01.344
Now, it's your turn.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.629
Use the environment on the next concept to follow

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.329
along with creating your first multiple linear aggression model.
