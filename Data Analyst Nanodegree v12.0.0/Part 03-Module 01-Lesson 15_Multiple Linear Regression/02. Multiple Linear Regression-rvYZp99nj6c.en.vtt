00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.299
Let's imagine you're looking to invest in a home.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.449
In particular, you would like to purchase a home where you

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.410
think it's worth more than the listed price.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.669
We collect information on recently sold homes to use in your pursuit.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.640
Here is a table of the information you collect, the price of the home,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.230
the neighborhood which has three categories of neighborhoods a,b or c,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.945
the square footage of the house,

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:28.414
the number of bedrooms,

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:30.875
the number of bathrooms and the style,

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.814
either ranch, Victorian or lodge.

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:34.939
In the last lesson,

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.199
you learned how to use one of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.355
these quantitative columns to predict the price of the house.

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:41.704
But what if we wanted to use all of these?

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:43.519
And what about these columns?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.730
Multiplying a slope of seven by a neighborhood of a,

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.494
or homestyle Victorian, what would that even mean?

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:54.104
It turns out that we can use linear algebra to predict

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:57.765
the y value using all of these inputs at the same time.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:01.256
The way we do this is by creating a matrix of inputs,

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:06.034
so these values here and we create a vector of the response that we want to predict.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:10.140
This matrix is often denoted as a capital X,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.620
while this vector for the response is denoted with Y.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.844
To differentiate from the notation you saw

00:01:15.844 --> 00:01:19.319
earlier each of these generally is notated as bold.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.929
In order to really grasp all of what is

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.050
happening with multiple linear regression and how it works,

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.799
you need to understand how these vectors and matrices work together.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.819
There is a matrix and numpy refresher course but I pulled from

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.129
the Deep Learning Nanodegree class to help with

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:37.769
these ideas and the extra curricular materials.

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.599
Additionally, there is a link to

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.000
the available linear algebra courses on Khan Academy link below.
