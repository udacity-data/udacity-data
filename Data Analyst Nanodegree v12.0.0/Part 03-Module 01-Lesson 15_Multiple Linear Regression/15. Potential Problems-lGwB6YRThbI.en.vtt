00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:05.434
When building multiple linear regression models,

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.694
there's a number of problems that may arise.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.190
But defining what constitutes as a problem,

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.269
is depending on what your model is going to be used for.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.469
Are you using your model to understand how your x and y variables are related?

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:21.259
Are you using your model to best predict the response variable?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.210
Or are you interested in finding

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.380
which variables are really useful in predicting your response?

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.515
Each of these could have a number of problems that arise with it.

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:33.590
Depending on which aspects you're most interested in,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.950
this can help determine which problems you actually care about addressing.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.592
In Introduction to statistical learning,

00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:42.740
the following problems are identified.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.545
First, a linear relationship may not exist between your response and predictor variables.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:51.188
Second, you might have correlated errors.

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:54.718
Third, you might not have constant variance of your errors.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:59.210
Fourth, you might have outliers or leverage points that hurt your model.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.429
Or last, you might have more linearity.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.674
There are entire books and courses aimed at each of these potential problems,

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:11.075
so the discussion of these topics and this class will not be exhaustive.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:14.030
But Chapter three dives into each of the above.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.670
I'm going to take a more industry focused approach towards addressing these problems,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.745
where Introduction to statistical learning takes on a more academic approach.

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:28.003
A summary of the academic approach is provided in the following concept.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.890
But if you want to see how this is applied in practice,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.000
feel free to move on to the applied portion that follows.
