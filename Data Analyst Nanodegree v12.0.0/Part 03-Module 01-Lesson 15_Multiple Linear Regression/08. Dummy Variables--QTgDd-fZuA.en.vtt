00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:05.660
So you saw that you can't add categorical explanatory variables into

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.679
your X matrix as nicely as you were able to add quantitative variables.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.554
Instead of adding columns like this into your X matrix with values such as A,

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:16.399
B, and C for the neighborhood,

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.759
we end up creating what are known as dummy variables.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.505
There are a few different ways to encode dummy variables.

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:28.254
But most commonly used are the ones where you encode one and zero.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:33.524
The way this works is we create a column for each value in this column.

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:35.244
And for each column,

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:40.344
there's a one if the value exists in the column and a zero otherwise.

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:45.100
So the column we would create for the A values would look like this.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.145
Then, when we want to create a column for the B values,

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:49.615
it would look like this.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.920
And finally, the last column for C would look like this.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.690
You will want to do this for each of

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.859
the categorical variables that you want to add in your data set.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.695
Because this last column can be inferred from the earlier two columns,

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.245
as the one values are only in the rows

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.200
that didn't have ones in one of these other columns,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.219
we actually end up choosing to drop this column.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.875
Which one you drop doesn't really matter too much.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.215
In the next concept,

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:20.750
you will see the mathematical reasoning for dropping a column.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.280
And then, the screencast will show you how this works in practice.
