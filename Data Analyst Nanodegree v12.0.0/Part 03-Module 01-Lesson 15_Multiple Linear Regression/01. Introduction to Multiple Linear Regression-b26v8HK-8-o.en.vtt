00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.189
In the last lesson, you learned about how you can predict

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.929
the response variable using a single explanatory variable in simple linear regression.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.115
In this lesson, you'll extend that knowledge further.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:18.690
You will learn about how you can predict a response variable by using multiple inputs,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.335
including both quantitative and categorical variables.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.929
With your understanding of simple linear regression,

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.620
you're in a great position to master the ideas in this lesson.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.164
At the end of this lesson,

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:34.109
you will learn not only how to build multiple linear regression models in Python,

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.950
but you will also learn the pros and cons of this modeling technique,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.020
and how to interpret your results.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.240
For those who like additional resources,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.785
I've linked a full text of introduction to statistical learning.

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:47.359
This is a great book.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.325
Chapter three specifically, is a great resource for this lesson.

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:53.000
With that, let's get started.
