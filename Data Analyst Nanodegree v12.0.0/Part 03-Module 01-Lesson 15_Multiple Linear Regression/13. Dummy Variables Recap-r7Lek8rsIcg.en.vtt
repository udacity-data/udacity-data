00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:07.584
You now have learned about how you can use categorical variables and regression models.

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:09.910
You saw not only how to fit models using

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.775
these categorical variables but also how to interpret the results.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:17.140
At this point, you are familiar with the most common method that's

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.339
used in programming languages like Python and R. However,

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.530
there's one additional method for encoding

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.905
dummy variables that's really common in a programming language called SAS.

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:32.410
For SAS, the default encoding is one zero negative one.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.509
SAS is an extremely popular programming language used in health related fields.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:40.899
The biggest reason for noting this difference is that it changes

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.640
your coefficients that you get back from

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.410
the model as well as how you interpret those coefficients.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.744
You solve it using one zero encoding,

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:53.024
your interpreter coefficients as a comparison to a baseline category.

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:56.289
However, if use one zero negative one encoding,

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.820
your coefficients are in comparison to the average regardless of the group.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.780
Just so you can see how this will work and how the results will change,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.000
I've added a notebook and a couple of quizzes in the next concept.
