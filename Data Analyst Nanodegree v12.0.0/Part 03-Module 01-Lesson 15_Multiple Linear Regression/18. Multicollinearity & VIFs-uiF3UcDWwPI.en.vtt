00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:05.400
You saw in the previous example a case where

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.195
your X variables were correlated with one another.

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:12.480
This can lead to flipped regression coefficients from the expected relationships,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.509
and inaccurate hypothesis testing results.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.675
We want X variables to be related to Y,

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:24.535
but when the X variables are related to one another these results can be very misleading.

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:28.199
You saw that two ways you might identify multicollinearity are

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.115
with a Scatterplot Matrix or with Variance Inflation Factors,

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.885
or VIFs for short.

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:36.570
A quick check of having large VIFs.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.664
A rule of thumb is that if you have larger than ten for a VIF,

00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:43.004
then you have multicollinearity in your model.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:48.285
VIF for a particular variable is computed as one over one minus R squared,

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:51.389
where the R squared is computed as the R squared for

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.609
that X variable being predicted by all the other X variables.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.125
Therefore, if the X is highly related to the other variables this portion increases,

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:06.599
which decreases the entire denominator and increases the VIF for that term.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.384
You can imagine that it's unusual to find only one large VIF in a model,

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.760
because if two or more X variables are related to one another,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.025
you would expect each of these variables to have a high VIF.

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:21.840
The most common way to work with variables that are correlated in regression,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.490
is to remove the one or ones that are of least interest.
