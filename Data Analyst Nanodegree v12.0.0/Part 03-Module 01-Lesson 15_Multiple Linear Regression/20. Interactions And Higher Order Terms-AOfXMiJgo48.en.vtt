00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:06.790
It is possible to fit linear models that look like non-linear models,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.745
by adding higher order terms, like interactions,

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:14.264
quadratics, cubics, and even higher order values to your model.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:18.024
Though these higher order terms might allow you to better predict your response,

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:20.829
I often shy away from using these types of terms,

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.344
unless I specifically see the relationship in the data.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:28.479
Adding these terms makes interpreting the results of your data more complex,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.774
and the interpretations you had for lower order terms,

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:33.789
like the slopes on square footage,

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.984
or for the slope on the level of a categorical variable,

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:41.469
are no longer easily interpreted when these terms show up in higher order terms.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.379
Let's try adding some of these higher order terms to your model,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.010
just so you can see how they might work and how to identify when to use one.
