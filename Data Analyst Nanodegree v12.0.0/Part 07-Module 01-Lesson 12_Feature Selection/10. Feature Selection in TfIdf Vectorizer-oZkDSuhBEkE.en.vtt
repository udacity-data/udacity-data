00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.030
This max df argument will actually shrink down the size of my vocabulary.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.180
And, it will use it based on the number of documents that

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.230
a particular word occurs in.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.420
So, if there's a word that occurs in more than 50% of the documents,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.140
this argument says, don't use it in the tfidf,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.990
because it probably doesn't contain a lot of information in it.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.540
because it's so common.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.110
So, this is an example of another place where you could do

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.650
some feature reduction, some dimensionality reduction, as, as we also call it.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.180
But of course,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.310
you also always have your old standby of doing something like, SelectPercentile.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.410
So, I hope what you found in that coding exercise underscores this point that

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.570
we're talking about right now, that features are not the same as information.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.890
You just got rid of 90% of your text features, but

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.570
your classifier accuracy basically didn't suffer at all.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.120
And in fact, in some ways the performance improved because it's able to run so

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.080
much more quickly on the smaller number of features.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.140
So, this, obviously,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.070
is going to be something that you want to be keeping in mind.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760
Especially, when you're working with very high dimensionality data.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.080
Data that has lots and lots of features.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.730
You want to be skeptical of all of those features and think,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.330
which are the ones that are really going to get me the most bang for my buck?
