00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.750
And the answer that you should have gotten has to do with this last line of

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.100
code here where you're trying to make the fit.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
So remember a regression is going to be a supervised learning algorithm.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.380
So you need to have both the features and the targets.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.090
So when you're creating the fit,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.830
you need to pass both of those to the fit command.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.640
Otherwise, it

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.190
doesn't know how to figure out what answer it's supposed to be getting.
