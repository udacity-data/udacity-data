00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.020
So far we've talked about engineering new features that you

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.130
might want to add to a data set.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.160
But it's just as important to know how to get rid of features that you

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.670
might not want.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.990
Now it might not be clear right now why you would ever want to get

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.730
rid of a feature.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.660
You might be like well, but

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.640
Katie that's throwing out information, that's throwing out data.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.600
Why would I ever want to do that?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
And I would propose to you that there are many very good reasons why you

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.330
might want to get rid of features.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.300
We'll be talking about some of those in the rest of this lesson.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.850
But I want to make you think about it on your own first.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.418
So here are a few reasons that you might want to ignore a feature.

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:36.730
And I want to you to place a check next to all the ones that you think

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.260
actually sound like good reasons to ignore a feature to you.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.070
So perhaps one problem with a feature is that it's noisy,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.170
that it's hard to distinguish whether it's,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.300
it's reliably measuring what you want it to be measuring.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.600
Another thing that could potentially be happening is that a feature maybe it

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.590
is causing your model to over-fit for some reason.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.840
Maybe you think that the feature is strongly related or

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.850
what we call highly correlated with a feature that's already present.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.990
So it's giving you information but it's just repeating information

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.760
that's already present in the form of another feature.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.300
And then the last possibility is that additional features maybe they

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.180
slow down the training or the testing process.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.760
And so in order to keep things moving along quickly, you want to be working with

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.910
the bare minimum number of features that are required to get good performance.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.870
So you tell me what you think.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.160
Which of these are good reasons to ignore a feature?
