00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.610
The general message that I want you to take away from this discussion is that

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.570
features and information are two different things.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.670
What you really want out of your data is information.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.070
You want to be able to draw conclusions and have insights.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.710
And that's not,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.080
strictly speaking, the same thing as having lots of features in the data.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.900
So the feature is the actual number or characteristic of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.580
a particular data point that's attempting to access information.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.240
But it's not exactly the same as information itself.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.730
So for example, it's a little bit like the difference between the quantity of

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.430
something and the quality.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.920
If you have lots of feature you might have a lot of quantity of data.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.020
The quality of those features is the information content.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.220
So, in general, what you want is the bare minimum number of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.140
features that it takes to give you as much information as possible.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.080
If there's a feature present that isn't giving you information,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.840
you want to get rid of it, because it can cause all of those problems that we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.710
were talking about in the last video.
