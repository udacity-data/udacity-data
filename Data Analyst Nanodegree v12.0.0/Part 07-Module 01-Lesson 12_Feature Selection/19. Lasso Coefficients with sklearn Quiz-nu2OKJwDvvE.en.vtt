00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.770
I told you this was a tough quiz because we hadn't actually done this before.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.700
So hopefully you were able to find it on the documentation page or

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.939
on the internet somewhere.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.660
And so the way that you get the coefficients of a Lasso regression or

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.790
of any regression really is by calling .coef_ on

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.270
your regression, which in our case just has the name regression.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.670
So if you call this print statement, it's going to give you a list that

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.290
contains all of the coefficients that have been found by your regression.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.439
So you can look at this list now, and you can figure out which features have

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.700
the large coefficients, which means they're important features, and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.430
which ones have the coefficients that are set to very small values.
