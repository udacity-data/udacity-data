00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.469
Now this is a tough quiz because we haven't done this before.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.939
So you'll probably want to do to the documentation page to figure out

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:05.930
how to do this.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.390
Here's the question.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.410
Suppose now that I've done my fitting with my Lasso regression,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.845
maybe I've predicted a point or two with it.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.810
Let's say that I want to understand the effect of the fact that this is

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.760
a regularized regression,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.870
which means that I want to look at the coefficients of the regression.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.420
I want to see, for example, if it's setting any of them to, to zero or to

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.840
very small values, which is effectively the same as discarding those features.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.080
In other words, I want to start accessing the information of which

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.730
features are the most important in my regression results.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.570
So the question for you is what would you put in this box here

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.810
to print the coefficients of the regression?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.690
So I've already given you the print command, and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.830
the question is what line would you put in this box to access the coefficients?
