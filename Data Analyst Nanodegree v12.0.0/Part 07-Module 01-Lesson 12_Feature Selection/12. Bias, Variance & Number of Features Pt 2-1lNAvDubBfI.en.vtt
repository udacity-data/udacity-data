00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.890
Here's another question for you.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.710
Suppose you have a model where you very carefully tuned it to minimize,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.190
say the sum of squared errors on a regression.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.630
And, let's say that in order to minimize the sum of squared errors,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.360
you found yourself very carefully tuning the parameters, and also using lots and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.950
lots of features to try to get every little bit of

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.490
information out of the data that you could.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.380
Maybe you're using all the features that you could even think of,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.390
which could potentially be dozens.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.280
In this situation, do you think you should be more worried about the variance of

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.370
your model, or the bias?

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.560
Click which one you think is right.
