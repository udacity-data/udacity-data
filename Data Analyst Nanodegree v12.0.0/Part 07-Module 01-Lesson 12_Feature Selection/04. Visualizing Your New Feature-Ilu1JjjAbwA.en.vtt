00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.900
This visualization has made it clear that maybe the number of

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.130
emails from a person of interest to a given person is not that helpful, or

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.010
the number of emails that a person sends to persons of interest.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.350
But now I'm using my human intuition to say maybe what I want is to effectively

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.940
scale this feature by the total number of messages to or from this person.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.380
And this is something that I'm going to ask you to do in a coding quiz.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.840
So I'll give you the Enron data set and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.700
I'll point you towards the features that are relevant.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.820
I'll give you these two features as well as the total number of messages to and

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.000
from a person, and I want you to return two new features.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.080
So what I'll give you is these two features that you just made and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.550
also the total number of messages from and to each person in the data set.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.730
And what I want you to do is to do the division so

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.070
that you get a scaled variable of sorts in return.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.050
The fraction of messages to this person that come from persons of interest and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.780
from this person to persons of interest.
