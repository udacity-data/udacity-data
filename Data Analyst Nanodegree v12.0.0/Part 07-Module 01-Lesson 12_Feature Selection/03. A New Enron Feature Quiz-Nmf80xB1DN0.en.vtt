00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.080
The new feature you're going to code up will be

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.760
called something like from_poi_to_this_person, which should be an integer.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.920
It's the count of messages that are in this person's inbox but

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.660
are sent to them from persons of interest.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.160
So here's what you'll do in the programming quiz.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.730
&gt;From each message we have to extract the author of that message.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.400
I've already done this for you.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.070
So, that will be in the starter code.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.330
Then what you have to do is you have to compare this author email address

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.850
to the list of known person of interest email addresses.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.810
So basically, is the author a person of interest.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.000
You return a boolean, which is the answer to that question and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.490
then you repeat this over all the emails for a given person.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.770
So that the outcome is this integer.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.430
Give that a try in the programming quiz and when I show you the solution,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.490
I'll show you what this feature actually looks like in the Enron data set.
