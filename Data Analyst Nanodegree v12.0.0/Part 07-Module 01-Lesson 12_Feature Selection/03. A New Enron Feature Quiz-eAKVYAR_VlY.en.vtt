00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.710
Here's a visualization of the new feature.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.060
Along the x axis here, I have the number of emails from a person of

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.960
interest to a given person in the data set.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.020
Along the y axis,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.670
I have something else that I think might give me some discrimination as well.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.460
Which is the number of emails that this person sends to persons of interest.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.660
What I've also done is colored my persons of interest red in the scatter plot,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.380
so I can easily identify if there's some sort of pattern in this feature that I

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.660
start to see clumps of red dots all together, for example.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.460
That would be an indication of something that a supervised learning

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.020
algorithm could exploit in trying to predict persons of interest.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.240
And what I see is that there doesn't seem to be a very strong trend here.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.110
The red points seem to be mixed in rather equally with the blue points.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.360
Another thing that I notice is that there are a few outliers.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.130
Most people, we only have maybe less than 100 emails to or

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.330
from them, but some people we have many, many more that that.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.500
So this visualization leads me into the next step of repeating this process.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.950
Using my human intuition to think about what features might be valuable here.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.090
The thing that I'm thinking of at this point is maybe the feature that I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.628
need is not the absolute number of emails from a person of interest to a,

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:14.220
a given person.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.690
But the fraction of emails that a person receives that come

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.390
from a person of interest.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.890
In other words, if you get 80% of your emails from persons of interest,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.650
my intuition might be that you yourself are one.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.320
But of course, I have to actually code up the feature to test this hypothesis.
