00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.930
Now it might not surprise you to learn that the lasso regression is

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.840
supported in sklearn.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.320
So I'm going to give you some quizzes about it now, but

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.070
I'm not going to do them on the actual Python interpreter.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.270
I'm going to pretend that I'm one of your co-workers, and

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm kind of struggling to get Lasso regression working.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.730
And there might be a number of things that are going wrong with my approach.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.780
So let me show you my code and you can start to help me debug it a little bit.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.760
So the first thing I'm going to do is import the Lasso model

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.190
from sklearn.linear_model, the next thing that I do is I get the features for

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.580
my data and the labels out of a function called Get My Data.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.500
So this is going to return two different lists.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.110
One of them contains all the features.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.570
The other one contains all the sort of target values.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.680
The, the things that I'm trying to find using my regression.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.100
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create my regression, so

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.760
I just call Lasso open closed parenthesis.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.840
And the next thing that I do is I try to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.480
fit my regression using the features that are available to me.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.780
But then when I run this code it throws an error.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.370
And I'm trying to figure out why.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.700
So I have this all set up.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.510
And I'm actually going to give you code just like this in

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.210
the programming quiz that's, that's coming up.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.930
And so your job is to figure out where the problem is in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.860
this version of the code.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.400
And to fix it so that all of these lines run properly, they don't crash.
