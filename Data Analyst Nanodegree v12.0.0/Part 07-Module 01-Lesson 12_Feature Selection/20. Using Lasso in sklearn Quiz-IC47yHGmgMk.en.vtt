00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.770
So here's your last quiz.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.080
And that is how to interpret the coefficients.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.080
So suppose I call this print regression coefficients command.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.200
That's going to return a list of the coefficients on the different features.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.640
And let's suppose the list that it returns has two elements in it.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.158
One has a value of 0.7.

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:19.620
The other has a value of 0.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.000
In this situation how many features would you say.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.070
Are really mattering in the regression.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.600
How many features are really important?
