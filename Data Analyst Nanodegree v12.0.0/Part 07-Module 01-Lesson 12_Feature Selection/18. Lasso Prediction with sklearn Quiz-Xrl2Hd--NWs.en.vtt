00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.320
Now you've helped me fit my regression, I want to be able to predict a label for

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.220
a new point.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.800
So the question is, what's the next line of code that I should write?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.120
So just to be concrete about it,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.770
let's say the new point has the features 2 and 4.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.230
So type the line of code that you would put after performing the fit

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.090
that would predict a label for a new point.
