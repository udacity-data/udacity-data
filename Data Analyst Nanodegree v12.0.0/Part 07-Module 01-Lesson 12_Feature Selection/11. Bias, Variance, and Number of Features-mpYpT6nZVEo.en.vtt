00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.160
Using very few features,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.670
puts you into a classic kind of a classic high bias type regime.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.050
So pretty typical thing is that you might have several features you need to

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.700
fully describe all the patterns that are going on in your data, but

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.900
maybe you only use one or two of those.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.700
That's going to put you into a situation where you're not really paying as

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.310
much attention to the data as you should be.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.440
It's an oversimplified situation.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.230
In other words, high bias.
