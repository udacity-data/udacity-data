00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's start with the example of adding a new feature.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.620
Specifically, I'll be adding some features for the Enron data set and walking

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.270
you through how you can figure out whether you're moving in the right direction.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.340
Here's a process I usually follow when coding up a new feature.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.350
The first thing is to start with your human intuition.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.400
What feature do you think might contain some pattern that could

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.940
exploit using machine learning?

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.690
An example of a human intuition I might have on the Enron data set is

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.940
that persons of interest might have particularly strong email

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.640
connections between each other.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.520
In other words, they send each other emails at a higher rate than the,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.020
than people in the population at large send emails to persons of interest.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.480
The next thing to do is actually code up the feature.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.470
This is what you'll do next, in a quiz.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.980
After that, visualization will tell you if you're on the right track.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.230
Does your new feature give you discriminating power in the classification

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.740
problem we were trying to solve?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.500
And then presumably through this process you've learned something new.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.210
If for no other reason than because you have this new feature available to you.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.310
And very often you'll repeat this process a few times as you zero in on what you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.290
think will be the most helpful new feature for you
