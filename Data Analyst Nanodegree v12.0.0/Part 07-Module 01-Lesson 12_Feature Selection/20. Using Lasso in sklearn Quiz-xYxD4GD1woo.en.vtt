00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.014
In this case, there would only be one feature that really actually matters.

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.250
So we have two that are available to us potentially,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.150
because we have two features for each training point.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.980
But you can see that the coefficient for the second one is set to zero,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.410
which means that it's effectively not being used in the regression.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.520
So using this result, I can tell that the second feature is one that I

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.600
can basically disregard, at least in this particular regression and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.360
that all of the discriminating power is coming from the first feature.
