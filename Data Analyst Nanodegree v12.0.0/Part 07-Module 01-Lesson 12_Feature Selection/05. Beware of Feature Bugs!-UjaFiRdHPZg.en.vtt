00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.590
Now that you've some practice making new features, and

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.070
before we move on to feature removal, I want to give you one quick warning.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.140
Beware of bugs when making new features.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.010
This was a mistake that I made once or twice when working with the Enron data.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.210
And in the next video I'll tell you one example of a mistake that I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.330
made in a new feature that I added.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.140
A programming bug had crept into my new feature and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.310
what resulted was something that was a little bit too good.
