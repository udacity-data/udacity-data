00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome to the mini project for feature selection.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.840
In one of the earlier videos in this lesson I told you about when I was working

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.230
with the e-mail data, that there was a word that was effectively serving as

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
a signature on the e-mails and I didn't initially realize it.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.450
Now, the mark of a good machine learner doesn't mean that they never make any

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.690
mistakes or that their features are always perfect.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.820
It means that they're on the lookout for ways to check this and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.160
to figure out if there is a bug in there that they need to go in and fix.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.490
So in this case it would mean that there's a type of signature word,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.490
that we would need to go in and remove in order for

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.590
us to, to feel like we were being fair in our supervised classification.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.600
So this was a really big learning experience for me.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.270
So I want to share it with you in this mini project.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080
I'm going to sort of take you into my head as I was trying to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.080
figure out what was going on that I couldn't over fit this decision tree.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.760
And how I figured out that there was one feature or

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.070
a couple features that were responsible for that.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.080
And then, specifically,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.972
how I figured out what words they were and how I removed them.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:56.660
So that's what you'll be doing in this mini project.
