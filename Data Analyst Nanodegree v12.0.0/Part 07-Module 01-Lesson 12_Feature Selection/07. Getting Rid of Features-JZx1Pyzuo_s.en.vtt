00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.590
And I would actually say that from time to time you'll see examples of

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.640
all of these going on in the features that you have.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.080
They can be noisy, they can be causing your model to over fit and run slowly.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.370
And also depending on the model especially if you put in features that

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.550
are redundant with each other,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.580
that have very high correlations, it can actually cause the model to break.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.990
The mathematics stops working.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.140
And, and your code will have a, a problem in it.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.700
You won't know why.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.210
So any of these would be a really good reason to be skeptical of your features.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.160
To get rid of them if you don't think you absolutely need them.
