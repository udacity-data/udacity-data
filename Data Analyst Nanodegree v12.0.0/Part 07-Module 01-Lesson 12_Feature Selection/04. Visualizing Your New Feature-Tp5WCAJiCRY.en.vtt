When I visualize this new feature I get something that actually looks

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.200
quite good.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
On the x axis I have the fraction of emails that this person gets that come from

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.930
persons of interest.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.640
On the y axis is the fraction of emails that this person sends that they to

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.010
persons of interest.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.130
And I can see that while my red points aren't particularly tightly clustered.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.400
There do seem to be big chunks of feature space where I don't see any persons of

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.710
interest at all.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.600
So for example, if less than 20% of the messages that you send are sent to

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.490
persons of interest that puts you in this band of points down here.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.600
And it means you're almost certainly not a person of interest yourself.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.020
And patterns like this can be taken advantage of in your machine learning

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.590
algorithms to help give you better performance.
