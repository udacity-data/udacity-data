00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.970
And the answer is 15.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.700
It's this column over here, 14 plus 1.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.010
This will orient you a little bit to understand this data.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.670
Obviously, in a confusion matrix,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.960
you're happy if the main diagonal has the largest number of values,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.700
because all the off-diagonal elements correspond to misclassification.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.200
So on to trickier questions.
