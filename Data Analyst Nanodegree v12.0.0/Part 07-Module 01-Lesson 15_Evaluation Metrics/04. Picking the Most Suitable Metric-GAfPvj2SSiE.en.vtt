00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.410
Now that you've had your refresher on accuracy,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.689
which of course you're well familiar with from earlier in this class.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.500
We're going to talk about some other evaluation metrics that might be a little

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.380
bit more specific depending on what you want to be doing with your machine

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.800
learning algorithm.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.820
&gt;&gt; In many cases in real life you care about certain outcomes more than others.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.770
We have an Asymmetry.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.070
For example, if you write a cancer detection test.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.000
I would argue care more about that the cancer gets detected.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.350
Even if you tolerate, occasionally,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.390
false detection, than overlooking cancer which could be disastrous for you.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.760
That's a case where your performance metric favors one type

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.880
of error differently from another type of error.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.800
&gt;&gt; So depending on the metric you use it can help you really zero in on

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.900
what types of mistakes you might be making.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.550
And you can tune your algorithm for

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.270
exactly what you want it to be optimized for.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.130
&gt;&gt; And it's really important you know about this and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.520
apply it because otherwise you might not like your results.
