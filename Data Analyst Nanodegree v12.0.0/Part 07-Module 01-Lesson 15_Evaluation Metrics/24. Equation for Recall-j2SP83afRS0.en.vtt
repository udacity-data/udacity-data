00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.660
And the answer is the true positives plus the false negatives.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.760
Just consider Hugo Chavez, again.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.190
We said that the recall was ten divided by 16,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.930
because there's six false negatives on the left.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.930
So it's the number of true positives,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.190
plus the false negatives that defines recall.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.590
Try to memorize those formulas,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.090
they're very useful in talking about machine-learning algorithm.
