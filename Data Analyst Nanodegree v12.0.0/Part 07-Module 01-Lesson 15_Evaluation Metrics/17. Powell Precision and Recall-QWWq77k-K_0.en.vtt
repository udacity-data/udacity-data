00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.860
So let's apply the recall and precision concept to a different name.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.430
Let's take Colin Powell.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.100
Can you, from this matrix, compute the recall rate and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.170
the precision rate for Colin Powell?
