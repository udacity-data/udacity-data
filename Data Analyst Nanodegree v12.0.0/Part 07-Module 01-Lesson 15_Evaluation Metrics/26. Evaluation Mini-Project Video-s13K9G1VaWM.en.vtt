00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.410
In the last lesson, you created your first person of

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.670
interest identifier algorithm, and you set up a training and

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.020
testing framework so that you could assess the accuracy of that model.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.654
Now that you know much more about evaluation metrics,

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:15.517
we're going to have you deploy those evaluation metrics on

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:18.107
the framework that you've set up in the last lesson.

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:21.128
And so, by the time you get to the final project, the main thing that

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:24.149
you'll have to think about will be the features that you want to use,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.260
the algorithm that you want to use, and any parameter tunes.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.490
You'll already have the training and

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.840
testing, and the evaluation matrix all set up.
