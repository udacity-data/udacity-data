00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.660
Welcome to the lesson on evaluation metrics.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.660
Evaluation metrics are how you can tell if your machine learning algorithm is

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.360
getting better and how well you're doing overall.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.620
&gt;&gt; And we are at my favorite place in the entire company,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.470
which is the foosball table where I get to evaluate it myself,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.300
pretty much every day by applying or playing my colleagues and see how I score.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.980
&gt;&gt; And people like me who aren't quite as good at foosball might not

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.330
use wins and losses as our evaluation metrics, but maybe, I would say

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.330
something like how many goals do I score overall or how long does the game last?

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.417
&gt;&gt; In machine learning, it's really important that you know your evaluation and

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:33.151
understand how to apply your evaluation to measure the right result.

00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:35.832
&gt;&gt; And that's what we'll be talking about in this class, so shall we?

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:36.557
&gt;&gt; Let's play a game.

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.800
&gt;&gt; All right.
