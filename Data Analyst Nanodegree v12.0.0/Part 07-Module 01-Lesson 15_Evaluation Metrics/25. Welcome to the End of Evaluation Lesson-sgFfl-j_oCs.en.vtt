00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.600
Congratulations.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.360
You've made it to the end of the, the content of what we have to teach you.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.380
Now you know about everything from the beginning, the data sets,to evaluation at the end.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.720
&gt;&gt; And I have to say I'm a big fan of you that you made it this far.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.860
It's actually quite a bit of work.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.220
It was work for us too I should say, but it's great to still have you in class.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.530
And I hope you're going to enjoy the final little bit,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.390
which is a little more hands on work.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; A little more hands on work in the projects, and then a summary.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.890
&gt;&gt; And a summary of the big picture ideas, and then we can let you go hopefully

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.580
with a certificate that you can use for wonderful things like getting a job
