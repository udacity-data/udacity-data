00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.480
And I would say that all of these are concerns that you should have when you're

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.510
thinking about the metric that you should pick.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.800
And they do all happen to be problems with accuracy in the,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.340
in the case of identifying persons of interest.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.380
So, accuracy can give you a problem when you have skewed

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.750
classes because the denominator of this formula, all the items in this class,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.560
ends up being a very small number, which means the accuracy that you compute as

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
a result is something that you might not be sort of as, as trustworthy of as if

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.050
you have lots and lots of examples of, of instances of that class.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.180
Also, the second two options are going to be things you want to think about,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.260
that you want to pick an, a metric that's really tailored to the operation

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.540
that you're trying to do, and that, as a result, you might want to maximize

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.170
the chance that you err on the side of guessing that someone's innocent.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.860
Or that conversely,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.860
you err on the side of flagging them as a person of interest even if it

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.570
means that you catch more innocent people sort of in your net as a result.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.480
Accuracy is not particularly well-suited to either of these outcomes, but

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.820
there are some evaluation metrics that are, and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.830
that will be what we talk about in this lesson.
