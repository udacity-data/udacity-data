00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.700
The main diagonal is easy.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.070
It's green counted correctly.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.510
For white, I get a total of eight, and then the number of,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.420
and then the misclassified ones are these three data points over

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.980
here that I'm circling in blue.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.090
This is a true negative classified as positive, and it goes over here.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.330
It's truly negative but

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.400
predicted as positive, and these guys over here are just the opposite.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.000
They go there. So

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.001
next, you're going to do a seven by seven confusion matrix from what?

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.260
&gt;&gt; From the PCA lesson.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.434
The item faces.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:37.820
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm handing it over to Katie.
