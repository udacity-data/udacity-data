00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.010
So here's my final question which will be challenging.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.250
I'm going to redefine precision as a quotient where up here we

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.950
have the number of true positives.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.550
And down here we have the addition of Which ones on

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.220
the left side go into the denominator on the right side?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.340
Think carefully, and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.310
click on the corresponding items on the left side that go right over here
