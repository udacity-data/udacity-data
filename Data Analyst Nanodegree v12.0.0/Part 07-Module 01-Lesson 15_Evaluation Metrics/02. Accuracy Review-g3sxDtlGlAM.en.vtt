00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.835
So far in this course, we've been using a very simple, very straightforward

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:07.857
metric to say whether our classification algorithms are performing well or not.

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:09.782
We've been using the accuracy.

00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:14.110
Remember, accuracy is the number of items or data points in a given class that

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.106
are labeled correctly, that we identify correctly as being a member of

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:22.390
that class, divided by all the number of items or data points in that class.
