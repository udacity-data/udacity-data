00:00:00.298 --> 00:00:03.880
So here I'm drawing what could be the result of decision tree learning.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.610
Where again red is my positive class and green's my negative class, and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.800
then giving you a whole bunch of data points.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.660
And in the mere counting exercise I want you just fill in the confusion matrix.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.500
Once again we have a actual class and a predicted class.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.570
The actual is on top.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.310
The predicted on the left.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.610
And we have once again the four different cases.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.480
So take a look at the right side and do your counts.
