00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.660
And this one's tricky.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.020
Let's take Hugo Chavez again,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.310
where we knew that the precision was 10, number of true positives,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.360
divided by all the numbers in this vertical column over here, all zeros.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.410
We knew the precision was one.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.585
And the numbers in the vertical column, except for

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:20.170
10, recall those false positives.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.320
So the correct answer here, is we take the true positives and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.780
the false positives, add them up, and those become the,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.180
and, and those become the denominator of this equation over here.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.850
So, it's going to be the true positives,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.392
plus the false positives that fall into the denominator over here
