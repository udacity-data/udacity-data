00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.420
Now I'm asking a different question.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.630
Suppose your predictor says it's Hugo Chavez.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.930
You run your learning algorithm and it classifies it as Hugo Chavez.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.320
What's the probability that the person actually truly is Hugo Chavez?
