After assessing, you often need to fix problems in your data.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.625
Common problems include incorrect data types, missing data, duplicates,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.620
and structural problems, such as different column names in CSV files for the same data,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.294
or mismatch number of records.

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:20.040
Fortunately, Pandas has useful functions that can help with these issues.
