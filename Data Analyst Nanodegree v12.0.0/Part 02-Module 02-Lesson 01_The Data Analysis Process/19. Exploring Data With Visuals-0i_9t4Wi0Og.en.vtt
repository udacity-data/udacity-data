00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Now that you've cleaned your data,

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:04.814
you can find patterns in your data by creating plots.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:07.259
Histograms and scatterplots can help you

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
determine which variables will be used in analysis.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.134
For example, you can plot a histogram to view the distribution of temperatures,

00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:20.230
or a scatterplot to view the relationship between temperature and energy output.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.250
This correlation looks strong,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.160
so we will probably be using this feature in our analysis.
