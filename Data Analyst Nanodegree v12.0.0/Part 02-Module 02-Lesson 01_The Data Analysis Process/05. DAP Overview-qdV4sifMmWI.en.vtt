00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
So what is this data analysis process?

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.595
We broke it up into five steps: question,

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:09.695
wrangle, explore, draw conclusions and communicate.

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:11.790
This process will help you understand,

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.379
explore and use your data

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250
intelligently so that you make the most of the information you're given.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.199
Whether you're building your reporting dashboard,

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.519
analyzing A-B test results or doing more advanced analysis with machine learning and AI.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.774
Let's see what each step is about.

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:31.184
The data analysis process always starts with asking questions.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.539
Sometimes, you're already given a data set and

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.890
glance over it to figure out good questions to ask.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.105
Other times, your questions come first,

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:42.644
which will determine what kinds of data you'll gather later.

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:46.790
In both cases, you should be thinking: what am I trying to find out?

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.289
Is there a problem I'm trying to solve?

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.984
For example, what are the characteristics of students who pass their projects?

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:57.420
How can I better stock my store with products people want to buy?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.890
In the real world, you often deal with multiple sets of massive amounts of data,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.884
all in different forms.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.929
The right questions can really help you focus on relevant parts of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.060
your data and direct your analysis towards meaningful insights.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.549
In this course, we're going to focus on use cases with one set of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.140
data and practice posing

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.314
relevant and interesting questions that lead to valuable results.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.879
Once you have your questions,

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.859
you'll need to wrangle your data to help you answer them.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.230
By that, I mean making sure you have all the data you need in great quality.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.310
There are three parts to this step.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.359
First, you gather your data.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.269
If you are already given that data,

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:38.964
then all you need to do is open it,

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.725
like importing it into a Jupyter Notebook.

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:43.134
If you weren't provided data,

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.480
you need think carefully about what data would be most helpful in

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.189
answering your questions and then collect them from all the sources available.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.620
Second, you assess your data to identify

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.245
any problems in your data's quality or structure.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:59.375
Third, you clean your data.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.840
This often involves modifying, replacing,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.320
or moving data to ensure that your data set

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.939
is as high quality and well-structured as possible.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.699
This wrangling step is all about getting

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.549
the data you need in a form that you can work with.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.225
Sometimes, this step will be really easy and straightforward.

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:18.474
Other times, it's a little more tricky.

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:20.465
Now that you've wrangle your data,

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:22.860
you'll hopefully have good quality, clean data.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.485
Which means, you're ready to explore.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:31.960
EDA or exploratory data analysis is about exploring and then augmenting

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.270
your data to maximize the potential of your analyses, visualizations, and models.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.745
Exploring involves finding patterns in your data,

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:41.844
visualizing relationships in your data

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:44.949
and just building intuition about what you're working with.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.875
After exploring, you can do things like remove outliers

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:51.384
and create new and more descriptive features from existing data,

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.634
also known as feature engineering.

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:57.399
Many times modifying and engineer your data properly and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.745
even creatively can significantly increase the quality of your analysis.

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:04.867
As you become more familiar with your data in this EDA step,

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:07.209
you'll often revisit previous steps.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.400
For example, you might discover new problems in your data and go back to wrangle them.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.330
Or you might discover exciting,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.620
unexpected patterns and decide to refine your questions.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.314
The data analysis process isn't always linear.

00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:23.740
This exploratory step in particular is very intertwined with the rest of the process.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.825
It's usually where you discover and learn the most about your data.

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:31.364
After you've done your exploratory data analysis,

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:35.635
you want to draw conclusions or even make predictions.

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.729
For example, predicting which students will

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.474
fail a project so you can reach out to those students.

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:43.039
Or predicting which products are most likely

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.949
to sell so you can start your store appropriately.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.004
From a data science perspective,

00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.960
this step is typically approached with machine learning or

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.960
inferential statistics that are beyond the scope of this course.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.540
But there are additional courses on Udacity

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:59.870
they can take on these topics, if you're interested.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.865
Those are linked in instructor resources below.

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:06.230
This course will help you form a solid foundation on drawing

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:10.729
conclusions from summarizing data with descriptive statistics.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.149
Finally, you need to communicate your results to others.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.194
This is one of the most important skills you can develop.

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:21.784
Your analysis is only as valuable as your ability to communicate it.

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:25.975
You often need to justify and convey meaning in the insights you found.

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:28.265
Or if your end goal is to build a system,

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:31.199
like a movie recommender or a news feed ranking algorithm,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.610
you usually to share what you've built,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.420
explain how you reach design decisions and report how well it performs.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.785
You can communicate results in many ways.

00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:43.460
Reports, slide decks, blog posts,

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:46.864
emails, presentations, or even conversations.

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:49.569
Regardless of your method of communication,

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.730
data visualization will always be very valuable.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.160
So those are the five steps of the data analysis process: question,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.745
wrangle, explore, draw conclusions and communicate.

00:05:01.745 --> 00:05:06.379
Before jumping into how you go through this process on a real data set in Python,

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.000
we are going to work on building intuition for each step.
