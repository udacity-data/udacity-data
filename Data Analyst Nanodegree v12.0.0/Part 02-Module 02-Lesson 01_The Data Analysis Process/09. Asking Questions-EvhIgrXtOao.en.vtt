00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.054
Let's get started with the first step of the data analysis process: asking questions.

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:06.990
If you remember from the overview video,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.640
sometimes we ask our questions

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.429
first and use them to direct what types of data we'll get later.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.094
Other times, we'll get our data first and ask questions based on it.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:20.535
Here, we're going to practice creating questions with the real data set.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:25.289
This is data from the University of Wisconsin General Surgery Lab and the measurements of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.899
tumors extracted during biopsies along with

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.254
the designation of whether or not the tumor was cancerous.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:36.369
A natural question would be: how do we know if a tumor is cancerous?

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.784
This is a pretty broad question.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:43.134
It will be helpful to formulate intermediate questions to guide our analysis.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:44.780
Here is the Notebook I made,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.945
which you'll be working through later.

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:50.299
Take a closer look at the features and think about questions that would help

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.704
you learn more about these features and their relationships in the data.

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:56.454
One example would be,

00:00:56.454 --> 00:01:00.079
does the size of the tumor determine its malignancy?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.185
You'll find out more information about this data set in the instructor notes below.

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.960
What additional questions you have about the data?

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.219
How do you go about analyzing the data?
