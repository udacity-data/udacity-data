00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Let's use descriptive statistics and visualizations to

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.449
address the question we posed with this cancer data earlier in the lesson.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.025
Does the size of a tumor affect its malignancy?

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:17.850
For this, we'd ideally compare the sizes of benign tumors with those of malignant tumors.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
We can use masks to select all rows in the data frame that were diagnosed as

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.815
malignant then all rows diagnosed as benign and put them in separate data frames.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:36.060
First, let's create a new data frame called df_m that contains only malignant tumors.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.910
Here's a breakdown of how we got this.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.299
This part here, returns pandas series of booleans

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.594
indicating whether the value in the diagnosis columns is equal to M,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:49.439
and indexing the original data frame with

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:53.974
this mask will return all rows where the value in mask is true.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.340
In other words, where the diagnosis is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.465
M. Now that we have all the malignant tumors together in a data frame,

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:07.150
let's see summary statistics about the area feature which offers a good metric for size.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.185
Let's do the same for all the benign tumors.

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:13.030
We can use the mean to compare these.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.734
Although summary statistics like the mean are helpful,

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:19.549
it would be nice to be able to compare the distributions of

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.500
the areas of malignant and benign tumors visually.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.599
Let's see a simple example of using Matplotlib to

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.469
create histograms for both distributions on the same plot.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.840
Don't worry about understanding this code right now.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.049
We'll learn how to use Matplotlib in the next lesson.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.920
This visual suggests that there is a difference between

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.614
the distribution of areas for benign and malignant tumors.

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:47.119
We don't yet have the tools to conclude that these two distributions are

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.010
different or whether the size definitely affects the tumor's malignancy.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.980
However, we can observe from summary statistics and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.000
these histograms that malignant tumors are generally larger in size than benign tumors.
