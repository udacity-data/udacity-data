00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
Welcome to intro to data analysis.

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.639
My name is Juno, and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.910
A data analyst, is someone who uses data to answer questions,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.999
and that's exactly what you'll be doing here.

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.945
You'll tackle questions like,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.170
what characteristics make a tumor more likely to be cancerous?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.735
Or how much of car models improved since 2008 and which vehicles improved the most?

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.509
Or how does wine quality vary by type,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.265
alcohol content, sugar, acidity level and much more?

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:32.460
You'll also be introduced to some valuable libraries for data analysis in Python.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.378
Specifically, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:37.739
The aim of this course,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.520
is to give you the tools and confidence to analyze data with Python and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.280
experience going through the steps of the data analysis process on real data sets.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.410
There are additional Udacity courses that dive deeply into each step

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.809
of the process so don't worry if you don't get everything right away.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.880
This course doesn't require any previous experience with data analysis,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.120
but you should already be comfortable programming in Python.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.280
You should be familiar with things like, loops,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.620
functions, classes, dictionaries, lists and data types.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.805
If you need to learn or refresh on these topics,

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:12.340
check out the resources and instructor notes below.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.581
In this first lesson,

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.155
you'll learn about the steps of the data analysis process

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:19.469
and practice investigating on different data sets along the way.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.025
In the next two lessons,

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:23.010
you will complete case studies while you perform

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.090
the entire data analysis process on two data sets. Let's get started.
