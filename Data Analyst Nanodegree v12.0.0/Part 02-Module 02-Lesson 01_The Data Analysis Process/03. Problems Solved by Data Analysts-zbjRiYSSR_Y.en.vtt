Before we jump into the data analysis process,

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.139
let's talk about some of the kinds of problems you might solve as a data analyst.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.744
When many people hear the term data analyst,

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:14.070
they picture someone who works at a tech company and probably in Silicon Valley.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.765
Many data analysts do in fact work at tech companies.

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:20.550
For example, Netflix uses data analysis to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.600
provide personalized movie recommendations for its users.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.820
Facebook uses it in its news feed ranking algorithm.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.179
And OkCupid uses it to predict which people are likely to be good romantic matches.

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.920
In addition to building these kinds of systems,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.740
many companies also use data analysis to

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.300
publish papers or write blog posts about their findings.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:50.234
For example, Facebook has studied the ideological diversity of people's political posts.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:51.899
They found that when posts appear on

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.464
people's news feed written from a different perspective,

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:57.590
users are less likely to click on those posts.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.805
OkCupid wrote a blog post about

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.570
what are the best questions to ask someone on a first date.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.909
Did you know that long term couples are very likely

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.700
to agree about whether they like horror movies?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.305
Data analysts don't just work at tech companies though.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:14.220
Wal-Mart looks through their purchase records and people's posts on

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.980
social media in order to figure out what to stock in their stores.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.890
Apparently, Strawberry Pop-Tarts are more likely to sell right before a hurricane.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.840
Bill James is famous for applying data analysis to baseball.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.980
He used it to understand who the top performers

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.234
are and how to best predict future performance.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:35.909
And pharmaceutical companies have started to use machine learning to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.170
predict which chemical compounds are most likely to make effective drugs.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.320
Using this, they can make better decisions about which compounds are

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.904
likely to be a good use of the resources involved in running a clinical trial.

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:50.400
If you'd like to learn more about any of these applications,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.130
