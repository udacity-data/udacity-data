00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.615
Wrangling and EDA are sometimes used anonymously because their purposes often overlap.

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:09.285
In this course, when I say wrangling it means you'll be gathering,

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.419
assessing, and cleaning your data,

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.824
but the modifications you make when cleaning the dataset won't make your analysis,

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:19.945
visualizations, or models better, they just make them work.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.789
Alternatively, EDA means you'll be exploring and augmenting

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.730
your data to maximize the potential of your analysis, visualizations, and models.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.674
One example is engineering new features or moving outliers,

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.549
they can make visualisations more impactful,

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.839
for instance, removing outliers to zoom into the heart of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.565
a distribution or they can improve a models R-squared value.

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:48.030
We'll dive into this in more detail later in the class,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.490
but we'll take a first pass now.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.285
And remember, don't worry if you don't get everything right away.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:57.000
We have entire courses that cover each of these steps.
