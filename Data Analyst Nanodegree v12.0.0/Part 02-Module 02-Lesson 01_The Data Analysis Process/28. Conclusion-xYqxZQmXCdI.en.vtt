00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.515
Congratulations! You reached the end of the lesson.

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:05.985
You've gone through the entire data analysis process,

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.580
from posing questions to working with data using

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.169
Pandas and creating visualizations with Matplotlib.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.714
With the basics of analyzing data in Python,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.750
you've started your journey in data analysis with a solid foundation.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.379
In the next two lessons,

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.109
we'll focus on going through this process in

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.500
more detail from start to finish on two data sets.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.364
And, you learn more about Numpy,

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:30.000
Pandas and Matplotlib. See you there.
