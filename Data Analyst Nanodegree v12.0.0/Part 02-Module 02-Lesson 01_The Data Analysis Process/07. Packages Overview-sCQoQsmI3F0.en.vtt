00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
There are awesome packages for data analysis in Python.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.720
A package is a collection of modules or python files that we can import into our code.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.795
You can think of them as libraries of useful classes and functions that we can use.

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:18.344
As a very simple example,

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:21.029
let's say we wanted to find the mean of a list.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.280
We could code that manually by finding

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.745
the sum and dividing that by the length of the list.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:32.579
We could even create a function for it if we wanted to reuse it in multiple places.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.994
Or, we could just get this function from a library like Numpy.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:40.189
Here, we are importing the package.

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.439
This is typically done at the beginning of your file.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.549
NP is the conventional alias for Numpy.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.494
Importing it without the alias is still valid but can quickly get annoying

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:55.239
if you reference it a lot which will be the case for the packages we're using.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.155
Using a short alias helps keep your code concise and clean.

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.240
Three powerful packages for data analysis that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.210
we'll be using are Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.319
Numpy let's you perform mathematical functions on

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:13.169
large multi dimensional arrays and matrices efficiently.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.310
Pandas is like a more powerful and flexible version

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.545
of Excel that can handle large amounts of data.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.715
And, Matplotlib is a plotting library that can produce

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.975
great visualizations often with very few lines of code.

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:32.234
Links to documentation for these packages are provided in the instructor notes.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.980
Many people can be overwhelmed when they first try to navigate

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.245
the docs to learn and master these packages, especially Pandas.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:43.490
We'll slowly introduce tools from each one throughout this course so that you can

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:48.000
be comfortable using them and confident learning new things on your own with the docs.
