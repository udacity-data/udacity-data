00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Let's see how we can communicate findings

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.094
using visualizations with the census income data.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:14.989
Let's create two data frames to separate people who make above and below $50000.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.170
We can use bar graphs to compare the education levels reached in both groups.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.434
Since value counts returns the counts in order by size,

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:31.500
we don't have consistent x-axis labels for these graphs.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.490
It's ideal to have the labels in the same order if we want to make a clear comparison.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.159
Let's order both results from value counts with the same index.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.575
That's much better.

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:55.920
Next, let's plot pie charts to compare what work classes dominate in each group.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.585
Let's use the same indexing technique to keep the order of both results consistent.

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:09.290
Lastly, let's use histograms to plot the distribution of ages for each group.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:19.189
Interesting, the people who make more than 50000 seem to be older.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.884
If we look at the summary statistics,

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:24.890
we can see that the mean age for those making less is about 37,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.909
and 44 for those making more.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.364
This shows us that people making more are generally older but

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:33.829
these visualizations give us

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.799
a much better idea of how those ages are distributed in these examples.
