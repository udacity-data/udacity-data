Hi everyone, and welcome back.

00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:04.919
In this course, you'll be learning how to work with data

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.980
using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.925
These three packages are essential to your work as a data analyst.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:15.690
NumPy gives you these awesome data structures called arrays,

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.910
that make working with numeric data super

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.234
simple and faster than what you can do in pure Python.

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:24.195
NumPy is the foundation for the Python data stack

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:28.240
and it's really what makes Python so great for data analysis.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.959
With Pandas, you'll be using data structures called

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.859
Data Frames to manipulate and analyze your data.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.710
Personally, I love working with Pandas,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.924
and when you get the hang of it, I think you will too.

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:44.969
And finally, Matplotlib is a package for building visualizations from your data.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.299
You can make many kinds of simple plots with a tiny amount of code,

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.899
but also create professional-looking figures.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.634
Juno Lee will be leading you through the data analysis process with Python.

00:00:56.634 --> 00:01:00.820
Juno is a data scientist and previously worked at a startup where she

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.530
worked on a bunch of machine learning and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.765
deep learning projects for a personalized shopping app.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:10.109
Now, she is here to teach you all about working with data in Python. Enjoy.
