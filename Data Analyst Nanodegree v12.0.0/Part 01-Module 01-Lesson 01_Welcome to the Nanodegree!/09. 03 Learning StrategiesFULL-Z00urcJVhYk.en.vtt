00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hi.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.070
I specialize in the field of Learning Science,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.175
and I'm excited to share strategies on best learning habits.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.780
Before we get started,

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.679
these strategies are proven effective ways to learn

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.425
new material and have been extensively researched in fields of Learning Science,

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:21.635
Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.175
I use these strategies as I learned programming,

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:28.440
and I love sharing these with everyone I meet.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.405
Your time is valuable.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:36.245
So it is important that the time you spend learning is used in the most effective ways.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.844
Here are some ways you can do that.

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:42.295
Lesson 1. Space your learning.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.140
To remember or retain what you have learned,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.253
space out your learning sessions.

00:00:47.253 --> 00:00:49.419
Since you're spending five hours on,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.319
say, Saturday and Sunday,

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.850
spend two hours at least five days over a week.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.179
Even having shorter review sessions of 15-20 minutes a

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.114
few times a week will go a long way in retaining that information.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:08.194
This habit allows you to review the same material

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:12.763
repeatedly and makes the neural pathway in your brain stronger.

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:16.339
An Intern helps you recall the concept when

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.820
you're asked complex questions about it which,

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.614
come to think of it, is quite programming and data science are all about.

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.774
Lesson 2. Write notes.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.400
Don't type your notes.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.975
Study show that writing those notes out about

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.479
new learning material is more effective

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.865
for long-term learning than typing out your notes.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:41.119
There are few reasons for this.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.855
As you write your notes,

00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:48.405
you're making more connections between your visual and motor systems in the brain.

00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:52.700
Also, writing is a slower process than typing,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.930
but it forces the deeper processing of the information.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.970
Keep in mind, I'm not talking about verbatim writing what the speaker is saying,

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.270
but instead pausing, reflecting on what you heard and then writing notes.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.630
This deeper processing of information is more

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.699
effective for later applying that information in complex ways.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.889
If you want to type the notes,

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.459
reflect on what you're learning and then type it out.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.085
Lesson 3. Spend time recalling, not recognizing.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:32.585
Recognizing is remembering something after you see a cue.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:37.335
Recalling is remembering something at will, without a cue.

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:40.550
So when you're ready to review previous concepts,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.355
close your notebook, and force yourself to recall or remember the information.

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:48.629
Don't just read your notes.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.549
This makes the neural pathway stronger because you're forcing your brain to meet

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.600
that neural connection to remember

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.109
the concepts against existing mental models in your memory.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.370
I use this method often, for example,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.480
to remember the sequence of coding statements for typical coding assignments.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:15.435
Also, I do it frequently in environments that are outside my usual study space.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:19.430
For example, when I'm washing the dishes or when I'm walking the dog.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.735
So, try it out.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.740
Lesson 4. Connect concepts.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.278
When making notes, think about how different concepts

00:03:28.278 --> 00:03:32.894
fit together or connected and are different from each other.

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:36.675
These steps are all examples of deeper processing.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.080
For instance, in programming,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.780
you will learn about various data containers.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.625
To connect the concepts,

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:47.210
you can think about how each of these are different from

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.230
each other and similar and when you would use each.

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.739
By doing this, you're essentially making the network

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.615
of knowledge in your brain more dense and interconnected.

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:01.490
So when you have to do more complex processing,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.415
you can see the pattern more easily.

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:09.009
Lesson 5. Mistakes are learning opportunities.

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.780
Program requires a different way of thinking that you will

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.819
need to get used to when learning it for the first time.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.569
Learning it will take time,

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.865
so be patient with yourself.

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:24.920
As you encounter errors, review them.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.050
Take the time to look at the code.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.405
Add print statements to help you debug,

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.654
and then think through it.

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:35.224
Understand why they happen.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.340
It will stick in your brain this way,

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.369
and you will know what not to do next time.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.579
Don't forget, you can also use Udacity's resources such as knowledge or slack,

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:49.310
to see how others figured it out.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.745
I hope you will try out the strategies.

00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:57.480
We want you to succeed in this program and enjoy the learning process.
