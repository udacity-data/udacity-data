Hi there and welcome to the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.645
I'm Mike and I'm one of the instructors for this nanodegree program.

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:17.880
More and more companies all over the world are gathering

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.310
tons of data to help them make informed business decisions.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.250
However, the data on its own isn't useful,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.415
they also need employees who can make sense of it.

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:31.669
That's why data analyst and data scientist are consistently

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.030
some of the most in-demand jobs today especially in the tech world.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.620
The goal of this program is to help you develop all of the skills you

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.565
need to start or advance your career as a data analyst.

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:45.830
Not only that, you will also gain

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.020
the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary for work in data science,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.185
machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.645
This program has been built 3for students with some experience working with data.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.885
If you've run basic queries in SQL and know how to write function in Python,

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:03.730
you're ready to start.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.400
In this program, we will focus on Python which is

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.625
quickly becoming the most popular programming language for working with data.

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:15.320
First, you'll cover the major Python frameworks you'll be using for

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.380
most of your data analysis, NumPy and Pandas.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.440
Next, you will use statistics to make decisions based on data.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.340
You will then see how to gather,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.320
assess and clean data,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.005
steps typically falling under umbrella called data wrangling.

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:35.930
Finally, you'll learn how to effectively explore your data and share your findings by

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.255
building visualizations using Python's matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:43.270
When you complete this program,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.260
you'll graduate ready to get a job as

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.845
a data analyst or to continue your journey in the world of data.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:51.040
So let's get started.
