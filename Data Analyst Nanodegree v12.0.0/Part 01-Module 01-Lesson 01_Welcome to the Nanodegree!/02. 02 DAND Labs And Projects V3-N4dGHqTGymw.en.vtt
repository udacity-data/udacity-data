00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.035
This program is built around projects.

00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:10.919
When you complete a project,

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.019
you will submit it to one of our expert reviewers

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.615
who will give you personalized feedback.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.320
These projects will help you gain valuable experience and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.280
build a portfolio that you can share with potential employers.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.815
The first project is available right from the start.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.450
You'll query a SQL database comparing

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.975
the overall global temperature to transfer where you live.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.825
You'll analyze the data,

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:36.548
create a data visualization,

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.335
and write up your findings.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:39.950
In the second project,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.575
you'll investigate one of our curated datasets using NumPy and Pandas.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:49.715
You'll go through the entire data analysis process starting by posing a question,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.950
following it up by exploring the data,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.945
and then finishing by sharing your findings.

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:57.695
The third project has you using statistics

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.770
to make recommendations based on an experiment.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.920
You'll use statistical techniques to answer questions about

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.790
the provided data and report your conclusions and recommendations.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.795
In the fourth project, you'll gather data from a variety of sources,

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.844
assess their quality and tidiness,

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:18.304
and then clean them using Python.

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:21.755
You'll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:26.159
and showcase them through analyses and visualizations.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:29.420
The final project will have you using

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.835
data visualization libraries to explore a dataset of your choosing.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:39.424
You will then convey your findings in the form of polished explanatory plots.

00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:43.549
Completing all of these projects will demonstrate your proficiency in

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.920
the fundamental aspects of the data analysis process.
