00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.935
The normalization proceeds in two steps.

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:07.280
We just normalize these guys to keep the ratio the same, but

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.440
make sure they add up to 1.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.954
So let's first compute the sum of these two guys, please let me know what it is.
