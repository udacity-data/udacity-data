00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.180
And I'd say the best answer would have been word order because this

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.070
product doesn't consider the order in which the words occur.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.070
Whereas in the English language I

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.520
can tell you if you randomly re-order our words sentences don't make any sense.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.670
This message doesn't pay attention to the word order.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.550
So it doesn't really understand the text it just looks at

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.710
word frequencies as a way to do the classification.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.300
That's why it's called Naive.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.500
But it's good enough in many cases
