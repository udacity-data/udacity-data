00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.802
To calculate this answer we multiply for Chris.

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:08.781
The LOVE and DEAL probability is .8 .1 just as before and

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:11.379
multiply in the prior of .5.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.840
And product of the .1 times .8 times .5 is 0.04.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.920
The math changes for SARA.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.598
She was as would LOVE with .5 probability.

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:27.253
DEAL with .2, and again our prior is 0.5.

00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:29.770
Give us 0.05.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.051
Now, to normalize them to bring them into a form where they add up to 1,

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:38.496
we realize that the sum right now is 0.09.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:46.082
So we have to divide 0.04 by 0.09 and that gives us 0.444.

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.390
An approximation.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.603
And the 5 gives us 0.555.

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:56.821
If we add them up you might get 0.99999 or 1.
