00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.810
So you might remember in the beginning of this unit we talked about this example

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.500
where we use supervised learning to train the speed of our robot Stanley.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.820
Now we are going to do the same thing in the simplified example.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.810
So picture a robot like the self driving car in the desert adjusting it's speed.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.230
It'll do it based on some features we can observe and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.850
the features we chose in this example are just two of them.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.850
There's the steepness of the terrain.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.270
Whether it's flat or whether it's a hill.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.920
And then there's the ruggedness of the terrain.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.180
How much the vehicle bumps up and

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.840
down which we can actually measure inside a car.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.930
And what we do is we're going to set up an example where you're going to be

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.500
the machine learning specialist and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.070
you will help Stanley decide whether to go fast or slow

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.650
using supervised machine learning.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.300
So, let's dig in.
