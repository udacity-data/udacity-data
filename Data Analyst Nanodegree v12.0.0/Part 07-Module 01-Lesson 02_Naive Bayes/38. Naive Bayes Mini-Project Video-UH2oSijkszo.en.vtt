00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome to the first mini project.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.470
It's on the topic of Naive Bayes.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.430
We're going to have you do something that I think is

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.050
a really interesting application of machine learning.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.630
It's identifying who was the author of a piece of text.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.400
So for a little bit of background this actually came up in

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.950
the news a couple years ago.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.820
J. K. Rowling had written a book under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.310
And there was some, some machine learning, some text forensic work that

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.960
was done, and they were able to figure out that even though it didn't say J.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.860
K. Rowling on it, the writing style was distinctive enough, and the,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.150
and the vocabulary usage was distinctive enough that they were able to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.230
identify who wrote it anyway.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.470
We'll be doing something like that in this in this project except we'll

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.660
be identifying the authors of emails.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.260
So we have a bunch of emails from someone named Chris and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.710
a bunch of emails from someone named Sara.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.910
And the question is, using Naive Bayes, can you identify who is the author of,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.120
of a new email, an unseen email?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.950
So, let's get started.
