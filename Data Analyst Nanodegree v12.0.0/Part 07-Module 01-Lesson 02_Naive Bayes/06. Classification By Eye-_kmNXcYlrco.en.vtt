00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.060
And I would argue it's unclear.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.910
I mean, there might be a pattern.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.029
Maybe the songs that are like fall into this set over here.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.000
And as a result this point is included.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.090
Maybe instead they fall under the set over here and as a result is excluded.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.330
I can't quite tell, it looks complex.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.150
But one thing I can tell by looking at data like this.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.760
They also called scatter plot.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.980
I can learn a whole lot about my preferences and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.100
possible results even before applying machinery.
