00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.250
So this is the essence of Bayes' rule, which I'll give to you in a second.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.830
There is some sort of a prior,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.090
by which we mean the probability before you run a test.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.010
And then you get some evidence from the test itself.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.935
And that all leads you to what's called a posterior probability.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:19.050
Now this is not really a plus operation.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.230
In fact in reality it's more like a multiplication.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.380
But semantically what Bayes Rule does is it incorporates some evidence

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.680
from a test into your prior probability to arrive at a posterior probability.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560
So let's makes this specific.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.760
In our cancer example we know that the prior probability of

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.648
cancer is 0.01 which is the same as 1%.

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:50.480
The posterior of the probability of cancer given that our test says positive,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.210
abbreviated here as positive,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.880
is the product of the prior times our test sensitivity.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.390
Which is, what are the chance of a positive result given that I have cancer.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.940
And you might remember this one was 0.9, or 90%.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.660
Now, just to warn you, this isn't quite correct.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.260
To make this correct we also have to compute the posterior for

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.580
the non-cancer option.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.720
Written here is not cancer, given a positive test.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.260
And that's using the prior.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.730
We know that P of Not C is 0.99.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.050
It's 1 minus P of C.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.350
Times the probability of getting a positive test result given Not C.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.800
Realize these two equations are the same but exchange C for not C.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.750
And this one over here takes a moment to compute.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.620
We know that our test gives us a negative result if it cancer free, 0.9 chance.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.253
And as a result it gives us a positive result in

00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:55.330
the cancer free case with 10% chance.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.290
Now, what's interesting, is that this is about the correct equation.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.205
Except the probabilities don't add up to 1.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.990
To see, I'm going to ask you to compute those.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.160
So please give us, give me the exact numbers, for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.060
the first expression, and the second expression, written over here.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.310
Using our example up here.
