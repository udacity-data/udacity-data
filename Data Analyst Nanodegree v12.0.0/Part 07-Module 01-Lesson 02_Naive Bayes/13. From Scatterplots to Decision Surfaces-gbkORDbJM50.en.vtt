00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.930
What our machine learning algorithms do is,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.070
they define what's called a decision surface.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.500
They typically lies somewhere between the two different classes,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.280
like this one over here.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.070
And on one side they will predict red cross for every possible data point.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.300
Whereas on the other, they predict the opposite concept.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.620
So with the decision surface over here,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.210
it's now easy to say what the label would be for data point over here.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.840
And again, I give you two choices, red cross or blue circle
