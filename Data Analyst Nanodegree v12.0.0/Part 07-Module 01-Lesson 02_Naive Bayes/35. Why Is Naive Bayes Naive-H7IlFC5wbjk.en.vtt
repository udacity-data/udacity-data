00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.945
So let me just explain to you why this is called Naive Bayes.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.140
What we've done is we've said there's unknown concepts.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.470
These are our target labels.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.210
Let's call them label A and label B.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.160
And you don't get to see them.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.660
They're hidden.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.710
As is always the case in, in supervised learning.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.110
And what you're going to see instead.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.820
are things that they do.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.890
Like words they use.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.960
If they use them with exactly the same probability you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.310
could never figure out what it is.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.384
If they use it with different probabilities and they might use one of them or

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:33.814
a 100 or a 1,000.

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:38.224
But every word that you see like this one over here gives you

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:42.910
evidence as to whether it was person A or person B.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.410
And what you do is, you just multiply all the evidences for every word you see.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.230
And it's a big product.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.670
You do this for person A and for person B.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.460
And you multiply in the prior and when this product comes out,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.620
it gives you the ratio of whether you believe it's person A or person B.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.300
That is called Naive Bayes.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.050
It let's you identify from a text source whether this label is more likely or

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.070
this label is more likely.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.060
And you can do this with people, with news sources, you can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.480
ask the question was the text written by Shakespeare or by somebody else.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.450
It's a very powerful tool, that's widely used all across machine learning.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.050
And the reason why it's called Naive

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200
is because it ignores one thing, and you tell me which one it is?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.730
All the individual words in the message,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.700
the order of your words inside a message,.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.600
Or the length of the message.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270
Which one is being plainly ignored here?
