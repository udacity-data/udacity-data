00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.880
Now let's look at different data set.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's take myself.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.720
I have a very different taste so

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.040
in my world I don't like the But here's my situation.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.700
I'm much more scattered in the way I look at songs.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.340
If I now hear this new song right over here what do

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.060
you think is the best answer just looking at the data.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580
Do I like this new song?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.890
Do I not like it?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.940
Or is this plainly unclear?

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.800
Take your best guess.
