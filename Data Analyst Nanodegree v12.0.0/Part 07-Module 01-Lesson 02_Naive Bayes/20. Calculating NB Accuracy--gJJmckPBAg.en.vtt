00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.000
All right. Fantastic.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.350
So we're almost there.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.050
There's going to be one more thing that I'm going to ask you to do before we

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.850
finish with this unit and that is to evaluate our classifier.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.230
To quantify how well it's doing at classifying points.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.070
Whether they're terrain that we can drive fast on or

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.430
terrain where we have to go more slowly.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.910
So the metric that we're going to use in this case to decide how

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.500
well our algorithm is doing is the accuracy.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.510
Accuracy is just the number of points that are classified correctly divided by

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.120
the total number of points in the test set.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.180
So the quiz that I want you to answer right now is to tell me

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.190
what the accuracy is of this Naive Bayes classifier that we've just made.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.950
And so there are two different ways that we can do this.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.820
The first is that you can actually take the the predictions that you've

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.030
made here and you can compare them to the labels in your test set.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.805
Or what you can actually do is head back over to

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:55.387
the scikit-learn documentation and see if there's some

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:59.794
scikit-learn function that might be able to take care of this for you.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:04.010
So, computing this accuracy element by element is one way that you can do it or

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.840
if you want to be a little bit more adventurous.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.350
Go check out the documentation and maybe there's a really cool one-liner that

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.310
you can use from sklearn that'll take care of this for you.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.920
Okay?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.440
So the quiz question is basically, do this calculation either on your own or

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.290
using sklearn and tell me how accurate our classifier is.
