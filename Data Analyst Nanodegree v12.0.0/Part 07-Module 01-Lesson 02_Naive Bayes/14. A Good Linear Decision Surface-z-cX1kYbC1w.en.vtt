00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.970
And this was a tricky question.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.900
I would pick this one.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.020
This one over here is obviously not good because we

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.110
even misclassifying our existing data.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.270
These are on the wrong side of the decision surface.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.680
So let's take this one out.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.560
But the one going vertical here does correctly classify most data points.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.735
Except for this one over here.

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:23.930
And also comes very close to the red cross over here.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.390
That's something we're going to explore later in this class.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.140
But for the time being what you should notice is that what

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.400
you're machine learning algorithm does it takes in data and

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.560
it transforms it into a decision surface.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.870
D.S.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440
That for all future cases

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.160
can enable you to make a determination of wether it's a red cross or

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.270
a blue circle, and that is very powerful.
