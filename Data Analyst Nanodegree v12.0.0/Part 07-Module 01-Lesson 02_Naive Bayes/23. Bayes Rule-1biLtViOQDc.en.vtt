00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.315
So this unit is a tough one.

00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:07.520
We're going to talk about perhaps the holy grail of probabilistic inference,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.350
that's called Bayes rule.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.100
Bayes rule is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes who used this principle to

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.239
infer the existence of god.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.140
But in doing so he created an entire new family of methods that has

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.380
vastly influenced artificial intelligence and statistics.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.210
So let's dive in.
