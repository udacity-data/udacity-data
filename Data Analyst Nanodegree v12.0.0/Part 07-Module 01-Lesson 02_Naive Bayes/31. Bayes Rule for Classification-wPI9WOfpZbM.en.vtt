00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.510
It's great you learn about Bayes Rule.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.470
And one of the things you use Bayes Rule a lot for is learning from documents,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.760
or text learning.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.760
And the methods they'll tell you about is often called Naive Bayes.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.650
It's actually a misnomer,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.330
it's not to be naive, not as in naive as Bayes Rule itself.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.030
But that's the name.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.295
Okay, so you're going to exercise this later in our practice exams using

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.230
Enron email data sets.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.920
But I give you the gist of it.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.619
Suppose we have two people, one is called Chris and one is called Sara.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.310
And both people write a lot of email and for

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.180
simplicity I'll assume that these emails only contain three words, okay?

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.190
They contain the word love, the word deal, and the word life.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.120
Same is true about Sara.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600
Obviously people use more than three words.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.160
But this area here is a little bit small for 30,000 words.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.760
The difference of these two people Chris and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
Sara is in the frequency at which they use those words.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.730
And just for simplicity let's say Chris loves talking about deals.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.410
So 80% of his words or 0.8 are deal and he talks about life and

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.730
love for a bit with 0.1 probability so

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.890
if Chris a word in email he's going to 80 percent of the time use the word

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.070
deal and ten percent of the time use the word love or life.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.390
Sara talks more about love, a little bit about deals, .2 and about life .3.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.300
And again that's a simplified example.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.280
What Naive Bayes allows you to do is to determine based on

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.260
a random email who's the likely person who sent this email.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.970
Suppose says an email that goes as follows love life, and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390
you don't know who sent it but you'd like to figure that out.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.426
Then you can do the space on base form and

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:48.280
suppose you leave a priori that it's 50% probability by Chris or by Sara.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.550
So we'll say p of Chris equals 0.5.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.270
That means the prior probability for

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.470
it being Chris is fifty percent and that immediately means,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.960
because it is one of the two, that the probability of Sara is also 0.5.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.980
So if you look at this intuitively, who's more likely er,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.110
to have written this email?

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.650
Chris or Sara?

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.490
Just check one box
