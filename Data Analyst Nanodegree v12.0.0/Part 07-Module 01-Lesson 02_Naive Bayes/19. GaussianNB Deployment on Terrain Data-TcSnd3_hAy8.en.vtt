00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.850
As part of the code, it will actually draw this scatterplot and

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.990
put the decision boundary in on top of it.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.250
So, the thing that you should see when you complete this code is an image that

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.430
looks like this one.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.480
If you see this image, everything's working right.
