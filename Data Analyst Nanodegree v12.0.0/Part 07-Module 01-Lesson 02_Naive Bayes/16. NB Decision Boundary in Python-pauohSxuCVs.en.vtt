00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.590
Okay, so let me show you where we're going with all this.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.420
We're going to zoom ahead on supervised classification.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.870
So here we have the driving data set,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.820
750 points now that we've drawn in our scatter plot.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.800
And the goal is to draw a decision boundary that will help us distinguish which

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.800
terrain we need to go slow on and which terrain we can go really fast.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.419
So that means being able to draw a boundary that looks something like this,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.820
where we're able to divide the two classes.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.870
And here's what that's going to look like.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.390
So we have our decision boundary that we can draw in here between our two

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.400
classes, and for any arbitrary point, we can immediately classify it as

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.960
terrain where we have to go slow or terrain where we can drive really fast.
