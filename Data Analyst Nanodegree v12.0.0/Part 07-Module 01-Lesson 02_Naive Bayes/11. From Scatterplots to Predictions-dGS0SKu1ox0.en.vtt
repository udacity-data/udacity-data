00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.180
So let's look at another scatter plot.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.280
Suppose this is your data,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.390
and again it comes in two categories in two dimensions.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.660
And now we get a new data point,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.100
and that came out over here, drawing the little question mark.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.550
One of the absolutely important questions in machine learning is what can you

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.930
say about a new data point you've never seen before.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.330
Given the past data and just to test your intuition, would you

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.150
believe that this user point is more like a red x or more like a blue circle?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.560
Check one of the two boxes over here.
