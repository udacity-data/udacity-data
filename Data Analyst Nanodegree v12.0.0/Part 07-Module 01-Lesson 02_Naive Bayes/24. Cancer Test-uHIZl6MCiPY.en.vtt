00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.230
And I would argue, it's about 8%.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.630
In fact, as we'll see, it will come out at 8 1/3%, mathematically.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.970
And the way to see this is this diagram is,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.650
this is the region in which the test as positive.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.910
By having a positive test, you know you're in this region, and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.210
nothing else matters.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.420
You know you're in this circle.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.820
But within this circle, the ratio of the cancerous region,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.820
relative to the entire region, is still pretty small.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.110
It increased.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.600
Obviously having a positive test, changes your cancer probability, but

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.920
it only increases by a factor of about eight.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.050
As we'll see in a second.
