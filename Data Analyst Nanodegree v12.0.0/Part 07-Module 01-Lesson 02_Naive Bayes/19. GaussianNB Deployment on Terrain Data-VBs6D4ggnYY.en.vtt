00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.990
All right, so let me actually show you the code that I used to do

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.710
that example that we just saw, and then you're just going to be

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.000
copying this code in the quiz to make sure that you get all the details.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.790
This stuff that I've just highlighted is the code that's really important, and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.120
hopefully this looks really familiar to what you just saw in the example.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.860
So, what I've already done up to this point is I've loaded in my

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.550
training data and I've made some visualizations of it.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.090
We're going to ignore that for now.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.300
But you'll be able to see the code in the quiz if, if you're interested.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.490
And then here, as I said, are the four lines that are really important.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.680
So, we have the import statement like you just saw in the example.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.540
Then we create the classifier.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.530
We fit it, using our training features and our training labels.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.280
And then the last thing that we do is we create a vector of predictions,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.700
this called pred, by using the predict function on our trained classifier.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.790
And then to that we pass the features.
