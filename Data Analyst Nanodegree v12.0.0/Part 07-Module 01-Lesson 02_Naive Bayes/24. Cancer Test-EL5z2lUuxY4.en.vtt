00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's use the cancer example from my last unit.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.340
Say there's a specific cancer that occurs in one percent of the population.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.348
And the test for this cancer.

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:15.180
And with 90% chance that it's positive if you have this cancer C.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.240
That's usually called the sensitivity But

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.890
the test sometimes is positive even if you don't have C.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.920
So let's say with another 90% chance it is negative if you don't have C.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.510
This usually called the specitivity.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.870
So here's my question.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.430
Without further symptoms you take the test, and the test comes back as positive.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.110
What do you think is now the probability of having that specific type of cancer?

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.890
To answer this let's draw a diagram.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.680
Suppose these are all the people and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.810
some of them; exactly 1%, have cancer 99% is cancer free.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.300
We know there's a test that if you have cancer,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.090
correctly it is diagnosed with a 90% chance.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.324
So if we draw the area where the test is positive, cancer and

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:25.700
test positive then this area over here is 90% of the cancer circle.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.530
However that isn't the full truth.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.790
The test sentenced is positive even if the person doesn't have cancer.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.090
In fact, in our case that happened to be in 10% of all cases.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.000
So you have to add more area.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.186
It's as big as 10% of this large area.

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:50.580
It is as big as 10% of this large area where the test might go positive.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.450
But the person doesn't have cancer.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.080
So this blue area is 10% of all the area

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.970
over here minus the little small cancer circle.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.245
And clearly all the area outside these circles corresponds to

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:12.000
derivation of no cancer, and the test is negative.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.980
So let me ask you again.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.810
Suppose you have a positive test.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.610
What do you think?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.430
Would the prior probability of cancer of 1%.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.157
A sensitivity and specificity of 90%.

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:33.655
Do you think your new chances are now 90% or

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:37.252
8% or still just 1%?
