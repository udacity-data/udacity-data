00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.130
All right. So, here's what I did.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.360
I gave you the choice of two different methods,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.770
either writing your own code to calculate the accuracy, or using sklearn.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.360
What I myself chose to do was to use the sklearn accuracy_score,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.730
which is what you'll find if you Google sklearn accuracy.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.620
And so, this is just a function that takes a bunch of predictions,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.570
it takes a bunch of labels, and then goes through and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.120
does the element by element comparison.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.150
And then will give you the accuracy that,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.800
that your classifier has on your test set.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.909
So, hopefully, what you got, and what I got for the accuracy is about 88.4%.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.880
So, 88.4% of the points are being correctly labelled by our

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.570
classifier when we use our test set.
