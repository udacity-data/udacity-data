00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Okay, we are here in the Google Self-Driving Car.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.570
We're inside.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.040
It's obviously driving itself.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.070
And it's doing everything by itself.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.260
&gt;&gt; And I am here as a passenger.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.670
I'm really hoping that Sebastian did a good job in training this,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.540
because he is not driving right now, and I-

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.150
&gt;&gt; I am not driving, it drives better than me.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.149
&gt;&gt; I am at the mercy of this car.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.830
That's true, it does drive better than me.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.570
&gt;&gt; So why are we talking about self-driving cars then?

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.940
&gt;&gt; Why are we talking about self driving cars?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.380
Well we're going to start by talking about supervised classification, and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.060
self-driving cars are one big supervised classification problem.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.020
&gt;&gt; What does supervised mean?

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.170
&gt;&gt; Supervised means that you have a bunch of examples,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.150
where you know sort of the correct answer in those examples.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.140
So I know that you have an example of this from the self-driving cars.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah so I mean we train our car and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350
we show the car what's the right behavior.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.915
And we did the DARPA Grand Challenge we would take it out for a spin and it would

00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:46.490
very carefully watch us human drivers drive and would emulate our behavior.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.360
&gt;&gt; And in fact, this is sort of how people learn to drive, right?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.387
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. When I was a child, I watched my parents drive.

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:53.101
And they weren't really good drivers, but

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.190
I would still copy a lot of stuff from them.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's kind of like,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.560
in the way the humans drive by watching lots of examples.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.580
That's what computers do when they're doing machine learnings.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.110
You give them lots of examples, and they start to figure out what's going on.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.190
That's what we'll be learning about.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.780
&gt;&gt; And it's totally true.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.480
In this unit, you're going to be learning about

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.844
machine learning, the same way we program self-driving car.

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:10.720
You're going to program data and

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.450
test out whether you can make a car go fast and slow at the appropriate time.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.740
using machine learning supervised learning.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.280
&gt;&gt; That's right. So

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.940
we're going to be looking at a really cool terrain classification problem that

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.460
was very important for Stanley.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.420
You want to introduce that?

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.400
&gt;&gt; So, in Stanley's case, I was driving through the desert and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.000
the desert terrain is like ruts

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.340
and broom and can be very brutal.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.230
So it you drive too fast, you are running the risk of flipping over and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.420
destroying yourself.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.680
So one thing we've trained the car to do is to really slow down at

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.440
the appropriate time.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.320
We did this not by writing little rules,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.790
we did it by us demonstrating to the car how we drive.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.140
And it will just emulate us.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.830
&gt;&gt; How many miles did you have to drive to train that.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.970
&gt;&gt; Oh thousands of miles.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.220
We spent thousands of miles everyday in the desert.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.010
&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And it took quite a while for it to become smart.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.680
&gt;&gt; Your poor grad students.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.410
I can only imagine.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.430
&gt;&gt; Well, I was the guy who had the pizza for everybody, but, it was a great time

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.420
because it was no email, we just had the, us and the software.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.240
And every time you got the software back it was very obvious,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.340
the car would punish us.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.020
&gt;&gt; Oh, that sounds great.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.205
So, I think we should probably get started with that.

00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:08.008
Let's try out a few different supervised classification problems.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.639
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the unit's all about supervised learning, so let's dig in.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.140
&gt;&gt; Sounds great.
