Technically what this really means is the probability of a positive test result,

that's the area in the circle that I just marked you.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.220
By virtue of what we learned last is just the sum of these two

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.664
things over here which gives us 0.108.
