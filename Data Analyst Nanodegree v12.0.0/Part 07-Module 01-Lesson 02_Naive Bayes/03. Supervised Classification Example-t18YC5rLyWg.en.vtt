00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.940
So, here's what I would say.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.230
I would say that the first example of recognizing someone's picture from

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.040
a bunch of tagged photographs is definitely a supervised classification example.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.200
This is something that Facebook does all the time when it does

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.140
recognition on the photos that you upload there.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.320
Another popular one is recommender systems like Netflix and Pandora.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.400
They look at the stuff that they know that you like already, and they try to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.820
figure out what the features of, of those things are, those movies or those

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.700
songs, and it recommends more movies or songs that have similar features to you.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.280
Fraud is probably not an example of supervised classification and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.910
that's because we haven't really defined what a weird-looking transaction is.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.160
We don't have an example of what that might mean.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.320
So there's ways that you could still do this, but

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.130
this would be an example of unsupervised learning and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.000
we'll talk about that a little bit more later in the class.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.620
Another thing that's usually unsupervised learning is clustering, so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880
in this example, we don't know what the types of students are.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.720
We might not even know how many different types we're looking for.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.810
There's still ways that we can approach this problem, but

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.560
this isn't an example where you have a big bank of training data where you

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.800
already know the correct answer.
