00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.585
Well it's super bumpy but still flat.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.278
That would be the point right here.

00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:09.420
What I want to get you to understand is that these individual driving

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.360
conditions can be plotted in a two dimensional diagram where each

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.710
situation becomes a data point.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.590
That's called a scatter plot and for the three examples that are circled

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.405
these three data points are kind of identical.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.380
They have a scatter plot of those three situations.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.930
So very often, instead of looking at the raw data,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.380
we plot the data in a diagram just like this.
