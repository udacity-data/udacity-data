00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.040
All right, so let's have a quiz about supervised classification examples.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.630
Here are a few examples of problems and you tell me which ones sound like

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.260
supervised classification would be the right tool to try to solve them with.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.010
So the first one is, using an album of tagged photographs, try and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.160
recognize someone in a picture.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.540
Or analyzing bank data for weird-looking transactions, and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.900
when you find something weird, you flag that as possible fraud.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.000
The next one is,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.710
given someone's musical choices and the features of the music that they like,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.470
say, what the tempo is or the genre, recommend a new song that they might like.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.300
And the last one is clustering Udacity students into different types based on

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.020
the learning styles that they have.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.480
So, place a check next to which one of these options you think are examples of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.320
supervised classification problems.
