00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.700
I hate to tell you this.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.410
You did not get it correct.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; But let- &gt;&gt; So what did I do wrong?

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me tell you.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.880
So, when you're looking at the, at the new example,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.980
you have to figure what parts of it to be paying attention to.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.060
We call these features.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.370
So a feature might be the color.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.200
It might be- &gt;&gt; Like, white.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.370
&gt;&gt; How many legs it has.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.920
&gt;&gt; Four.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.300
&gt;&gt; It might be whether it has horns or antlers.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130
So a horse does not have horns or antlers.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.670
&gt;&gt; You're right. &gt;&gt; But these all have horns and antlers and that's what-

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.410
&gt;&gt; I see. &gt;&gt; Acerous means,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.510
is that it's lacking horns or antlers, antennae, things like that.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.490
So that's why a horse would be a, an, an example of an acerous animal.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.180
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.010
&gt;&gt; And this is, in general, what machine learning is going to be doing is we

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.720
give you a bunch of examples and each one has a number of features,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.040
a number of attributes that you can use to describe it.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680
And if you can pick out the right feature and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.930
it's giving you the right information then you can,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.760
you can classify new examples.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.270
So a smart machine algorithm would have outperformed me?

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.870
&gt;&gt; I think so yeah.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.600
&gt;&gt; Darn so let's,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.820
don't take this class because I don't want all you guys to outperform me.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.800
&gt;&gt; Well no I wouldn't go that far.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.440
I think the way to think about it is what's the way that we

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.340
could use machine learning algorithm to get problems like this right and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.600
that's the whole point of this lesson.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.099
&gt;&gt; Okay
