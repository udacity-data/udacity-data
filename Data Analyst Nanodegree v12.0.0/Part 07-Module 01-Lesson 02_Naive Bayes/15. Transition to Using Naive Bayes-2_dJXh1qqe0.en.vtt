So what's next in this class,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.115
you're going to learn of what's called Naïve Bayes.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.299
Bayes was a religious man trying to prove the existence of God.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.940
He wasn't very naïve.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.320
But the algorithm is kind of naïve and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.680
it's a very common algorithm to find at a certain surface, just like this.
