00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.460
In the next exercise, I want you now to compute a posterior probability.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.610
And, specifically, I want you to calculate the posterior probability of it

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.260
being Chris or Sara,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.840
given that we just observed the exact same phrase as before, life deal.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.800
So just add the number into the box on the right side
