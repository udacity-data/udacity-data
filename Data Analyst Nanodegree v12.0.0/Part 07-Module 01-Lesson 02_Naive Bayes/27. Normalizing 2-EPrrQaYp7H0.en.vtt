00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.640
And now finally we come up with the extra posterior, or

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.900
as this one over here is often called, the joint probability of two events.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.000
And the posterior is obtained by dividing this guy over here

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.470
with this normalizer.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.150
So, let's do this over here.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.230
Let's divide this guy over here.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.205
By this normalizer to get my posterior distribution, I think cancer,

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:28.590
given that I received the positive test results, so divide this number by this
