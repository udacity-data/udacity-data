00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.310
So let's talk about something called scatter plots.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.250
And I'm going to use the car example.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.136
When we drove our car we had days when the terrain was completely flat,

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:12.120
let us drive very fast.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.870
Sometimes we encountered a little bit of bumpiness or a lot of bumpiness.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.500
Which kind of forces us to slow down.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.420
So one way in which our terrain was able to vary, was at the level of bumpiness.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.220
Which could go from smooth, to really bad.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.450
Second dimension, which our terrain varied had to do with slope.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.880
Could be flat.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.940
Or, they were different levels of steepness.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.530
I'm obviously slightly exaggerating here.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.710
So it goes from flat to very steep.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.930
And, again, the steeper it is the slower we wish to drive.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.900
And, those things could co-occur,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.390
as shown in these scater graphs on the right side.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.430
So what I want to do with you is just map these training examples over here,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.830
of say a flat, smooth vote, into our diagram over here.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.890
And I give you nine possible points that correspond to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.780
all the combinations of the three bumpiness levels we encountered.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.850
And the three slope levels.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.550
And when I ask you to take a car set away from, like, this one and then define

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.030
the correct of the nine items that best represents the situation over here
