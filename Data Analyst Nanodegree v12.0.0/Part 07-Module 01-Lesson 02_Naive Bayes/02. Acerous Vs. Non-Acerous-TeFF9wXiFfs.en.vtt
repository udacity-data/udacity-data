00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.080
Machine learning is all about learning from examples.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.060
So I'm going to teach you something right now from example,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.920
something that you almost certainly don't already know.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.390
That is whether a horse is acerous.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.250
Do you know what acerous means?

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.860
&gt;&gt; What is acerous?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.585
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:16.880
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a bunch of.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.431
&gt;&gt; Then teach me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a bunch of examples.

00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:21.925
And then the question for you is whether you think a horse is acerous or not.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:22.489
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.117
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:25.280
So here's, here's some example animals.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.310
&gt;&gt; It's made in China.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.060
&gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with it being acerous.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.480
These are some examples I'm going to tell you for

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.460
each one whether it's acerous or not.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.770
An elephant is acerous.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.130
A ram is not acerous.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.808
Let's see a triceratops, the dinosaur, is non acerous.

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.084
Lemurs are acerous.

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:48.040
A dog is acerous.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.900
A giraffe is non acerous.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.460
A goat, also non acerous.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.299
A cat is going to be acerous.

00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:01.740
Parrot is acerous, and last a deer is non-acerous.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.500
And so the question for

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.440
you is, which one of these groups would you put the, the horse in with?

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.090
&gt;&gt; It's hard.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.440
I guess it looks a bit like a giraffe, maybe it's on that side.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.480
Doesn't look like a parrot.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.420
I put it here.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you, this is the, this is the non-acerous group.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.950
&gt;&gt; Now how confident are you at this?

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.592
&gt;&gt; I'm not at all.

00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:25.920
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; If I give you 100,000 examples would you be more confident do you?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.668
&gt;&gt; Yes. Please give me 100,000 examples.

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:30.350
&gt;&gt; These are all the toys I could find.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.260
So before we go any further I'd like you to give me your answer of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.740
what you think, what you think for the horse is.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.990
Is it asorus or non-asorus.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.140
Just based on the examples here
