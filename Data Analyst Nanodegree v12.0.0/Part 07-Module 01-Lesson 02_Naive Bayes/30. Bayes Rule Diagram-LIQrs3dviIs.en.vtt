00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.820
What we really said that we had a situation with prior

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.970
a test, a certain sensitivity and a certain specificity.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.120
When you receive say a positive test result, what you do is you take your prior,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.640
you multiply in the probability of this test result.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.240
Given C, and you multiply in the probability of the test result given not C.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
So this is your branch for the consideration that you have cancer.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.740
This is your branch for the consideration you have no cancer.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.610
When you're done with this, you arrive at a number that now combines the cancer

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.580
hypothesis with the test result.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.380
Both for the cancer hypothesis and the not cancer hypothesis.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.680
Now what you do, you add those up.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.580
And they normally don't add up to one.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.080
You get a certain quantity,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.240
which happens to be the total probability that the test is what it was.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.580
This case positive.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.185
And all you do next is divide or

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:04.160
normalize this thing over here by the sum over here.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.260
And the same on the right side.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.030
The divider is the same for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.990
both cases because this is your cancer range, your non cancer range.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.325
But this guy doesn't rely on the cancer variable anymore.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.950
What you now get out is the desired posterior probability, and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.720
those add up to one if you did everything correct as shown over here.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.510
This is your algorithm for Bayes Rule
