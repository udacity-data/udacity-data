00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.060
&gt;&gt; Welcome back!

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.734
What you just got was 88.4% correct for Naive Bayes.

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:05.460
&gt;&gt; 88.4% !

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.220
Awesome guys.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.420
&gt;&gt; Well, does that mean that your,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.480
your self-driving car only crashed 11.6% of the time?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.710
&gt;&gt; It'll crash occasionally yeah.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.060
It's not good enough for cars.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.690
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But it's great for this course.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.230
&gt;&gt; It is very good.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.870
It's much better than guessing.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.430
One of the things that you did in that example,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.870
maybe you didn't even realized you were doing it was you trained and

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.790
you tested on two different sets of data.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.450
&gt;&gt; And that's actually really important in machine learning we always train and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.720
test on different data.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.730
&gt;&gt; If you don't do that what can happen is that you can overfit to your

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.299
training data.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.890
You can think that you know better what's going on than you actually know.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.308
&gt;&gt; That's really important because in machine learning you have to kind of

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.668
generalize to new data that's somewhat different.

00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:43.280
An algorithm would just memorize all the data,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.540
test it on the same data as training data, which will always give you 100%.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.210
But it had no clue how to generalize to new data.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.560
&gt;&gt; That's right. So what you should always do,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.590
and what we'll always do in this course,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.940
is you should save maybe 10% of your data and you use it as your testing set.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.540
And that's what you use to actually tell you how much progress you're

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.740
making in terms of learning your patterns in your data.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.739
&gt;&gt; So, when you report the results to yourself and to your boss or

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.400
your client, use the test results, because it's much better,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.020
fair kind of understanding of how well you are doing with you training data.
