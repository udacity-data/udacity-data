00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:06.740
And the answer is 0.57 over here and 0.43 over here.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.450
And the rationale is that the posteriors are normalized to 1.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.942
So we've taken 0.4, for example, and

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:20.060
dividing 0.04 by the total, which is 0.04 plus 0.03.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.300
When you work this out, it's the same as 4 divided by 7, or 0.57.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.630
And when you divide 3 by 7, you get 0.43.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.950
That's the correct posterior answer in this example.
