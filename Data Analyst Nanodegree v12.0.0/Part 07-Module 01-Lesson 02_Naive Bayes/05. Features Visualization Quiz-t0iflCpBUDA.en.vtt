00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.170
So, here is how this looks to a machine learning person.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.460
We're going to produce what's called a scatter plot.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.840
And, for simplicity, I'll just use two features.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.370
There's tempo and intensity.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.570
And, tempo might go from relaxed to fast, and intensity, for

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.950
the time being, will be light or soaring.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.410
So, the song, Let it Go is mid-range in tempo, but quite intense.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.230
So, it would be a data point right over here.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.230
In for those songs, you can extract those features.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.630
And, each song becomes a dot in this two

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.160
dimensional diagram of tempo and intensity.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.400
This is slow song, it's very intense.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.990
And, this is a slow song that's just very light.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.100
So, I'm adding here data points for many songs.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.060
And, suppose, the green ones are the ones that Katie likes.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.780
Where as the red ones over here, are the ones that she doesn't like.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.310
Suppose we encounter a new song with features for

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.422
right over here, in the spectrum.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.210
Just looking at the data itself, that Katie would like this song, or

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.280
doesn't like this song.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.660
So, just check the box on the right for like, or don't like.
