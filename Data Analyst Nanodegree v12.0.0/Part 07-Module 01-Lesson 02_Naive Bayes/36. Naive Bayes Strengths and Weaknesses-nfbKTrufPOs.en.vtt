00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.116
&gt;&gt; So, congratulations, you made it through the end of the Naive Bayes

00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:04.050
learning algorithm.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.331
That is quite amazing.

00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:08.460
&gt;&gt; That's one algorithm down, two to go.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.580
What we'll do is we'll start a list now of all the things that maybe you

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.680
should be thinking about when picking a supervised classification algorithm.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.910
So that you have some basis for starting to make a choice between

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.140
the different algorithms that we'll be talking about.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.340
So there are a few things that Naive Bayes does really elegantly.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.660
&gt;&gt; It's actually really easy to implement.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.037
These were with great, big feature spaces. There is between 20,000 and

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:33.940
200,000 words in the English language.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.680
And it, it's really simple to run, it's really efficient.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.530
&gt;&gt; There are a few things that Naive Bayes doesn't do as well that you also want

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.700
to be careful of.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it can break.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.420
It breaks in funny ways.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.440
So, historically when Google first sent it out, when people searched for

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.350
Chicago Bulls, which is a sports team comprised of two words, Chicago Bulls.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:56.476
Would show many images of bulls, animals, and of cities, like Chicago.

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:58.280
But Chicago Bulls is something succinctly different.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.910
So phrases that encompass multiple words and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.960
have distinctive meanings don't work really well in NaÃ¯ve Bayes.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130
&gt;&gt; So depending on exactly what the problem is that you're trying to solve and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.790
the data set that you have to solve it,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.140
you shouldn't think of supervised classification algorithms as black boxes.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.550
You should be thinking about them in terms of the theoretical understanding of

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.720
how the algorithm works and whether that's right for

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.670
the question you're trying to answer.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.800
&gt;&gt; And you should, of course, test it, right?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.680
So we talked about train set and test set.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.230
You can check the performance in test set and see how it works.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.080
&gt;&gt; And if you don't like it might be the wrong algorithm or

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.890
the wrong parameters.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.390
&gt;&gt; Exactly
