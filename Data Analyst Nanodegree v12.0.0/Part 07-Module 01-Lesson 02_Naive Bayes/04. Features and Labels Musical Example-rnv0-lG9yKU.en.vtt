00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.719
So now we will talk about features and labels.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.640
And I'm going to be using Katie, as an example.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.930
See as my artistic rendering of Katie.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.520
And Katie loves listening to songs.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.990
And I know it's cliche but one of her favorite song, is called Let It Go.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.588
She really sings it all day long.

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:21.454
&gt;&gt; Can't hold it back anymore.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.802
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:28.880
All right so it's not about singing lessons it's really about machine learning.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.450
So in machine learning we often take as input features and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.120
we try to produce labels.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.617
So let me explain what this is.

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:37.721
[MUSIC]

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:42.830
Okay so we take this music and we don't input the raw music into her ears.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.010
Katie for a sec please.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.780
Okay.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.050
Instead we extract what's called features.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.930
These might be things such as intensity, or the tempo of the song, or

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.200
things like genre, or perhaps the gender of the voice.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.830
And then Katie's brain processes it into one of two categories,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.660
there is like and don't like.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.160
Obviously an oversimplification of Katie's brain, but

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.440
for the time being, let's assume that's what's happening
