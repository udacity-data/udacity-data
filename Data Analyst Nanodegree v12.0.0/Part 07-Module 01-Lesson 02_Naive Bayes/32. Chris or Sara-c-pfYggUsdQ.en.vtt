00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.910
And this one is actually not as easy to compute.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.580
It's actually a close call, as you will see.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.260
And we have to multiply out the numbers.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.478
So Chris uses life with probability 0.1,

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:15.390
deal with 0.8, and our prior on Chris is 0.5.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.120
When we multiply those out, we get 0.04.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.840
Same for Sara.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.590
Life is 0.3.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.053
Deal is 0.2.

00:00:25.053 --> 00:00:28.415
And our prior here is, again, 0.5.

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:31.621
When we multiply this one out, we get 0.03.

00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:36.740
So the correct answer here would have been Chris by a really slim margin.
