00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; Great job. You've made it to the end of lesson one.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.059
&gt;&gt; Yahoo!

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.136
&gt;&gt; So, next we have another supervised classification algorithm.

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:07.852
&gt;&gt; What's it called?

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:08.895
&gt;&gt; SVMs.

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:09.990
&gt;&gt; And for what?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.250
&gt;&gt; Support vector machines.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.100
&gt;&gt; I always wanted more support and now it comes with its own vector machine.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.500
&gt;&gt; Right, we'll be supporting Sebastian in using vector machines.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.210
&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.860
See you in class.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.400
&gt;&gt; See you there
