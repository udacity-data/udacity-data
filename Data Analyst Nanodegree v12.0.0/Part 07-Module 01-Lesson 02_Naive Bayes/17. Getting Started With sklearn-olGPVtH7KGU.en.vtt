00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.630
All right so we kind of zoomed ahead to the end there.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.790
So let's take a step back and walk through what I just did but much more slowly.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.660
You're going to see all the steps that I went through when I

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.930
wrote the Python code that just made that decision boundary.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.470
And by the end of the next video or

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.380
two, you will be able to write this code yourself.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.530
So the place that we start [LAUGH] as always maybe is Google.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.730
So there's a Python library that I'm going to be using a lot in this lesson, and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.330
we're going to be using Google to help us use the documentation of

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.090
that library to figure out how to use some of the functions that it has.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.310
The name of this library is scikit-learn, which is often abbreviated sk-learn.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.740
So let me get you used to that convention now.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.000
So I'm going to search google for sklearn and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.550
the name of the algorithm that I just used, which happens to be Naive Bayes.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.680
We'll go back in a little bit and talk about what Naive Bayes does exactly.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.700
But first I want you to have you running the code.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.320
So sklearn Naive Bayes.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.720
See what's out there.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.730
There's a page on Naive Bayes here that gives you

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.690
a derivation of the Naive Bayes formula and then a bunch of use cases,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.400
including something that says Gaussian Naive Bayes and, as it turns out,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.180
this is what I'm going to be using.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.720
So let's head back because I saw Gaussian Naive Bayes as one of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.090
the other results on Google.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.520
That's this one. Gaussian Naive Bayes,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.730
this is what the way that I actually wrote classifier that you just saw.
