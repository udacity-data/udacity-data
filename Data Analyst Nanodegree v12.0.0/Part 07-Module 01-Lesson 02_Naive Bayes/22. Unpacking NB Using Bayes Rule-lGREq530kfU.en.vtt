00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.960
So you just built an interesting classifier.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.100
And it worked!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.220
But now we're going to go into some depth.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.950
The next unit will be a little tedious.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.164
And we're really going to dissect the little bit,

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:13.113
[INAUDIBLE] bits of the algorithm.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.400
But stick with us and you're going to learn a lot about Bayes Rule.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.260
And then eventually Naive Base
