00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Before you start making visualizations,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.610
we'll first talk about the design of visualizations.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.714
When it comes to explanatory data visualizations,

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:12.210
it is important to adhere to good design principles in order to make

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.945
sure that your findings are conveyed accurately and clearly.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.335
Otherwise, you run the risk of your audience not following your story,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.890
or worse, misled to the wrong conclusions.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.530
Design principles are also useful during

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.725
the exploratory phase of the data analysis process.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.745
After all, there is still an audience present here, yourself.

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:37.829
By using design principles to select an appropriate plot in useful encodings,

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.769
you'll be able to learn from the data in an efficient manner.
