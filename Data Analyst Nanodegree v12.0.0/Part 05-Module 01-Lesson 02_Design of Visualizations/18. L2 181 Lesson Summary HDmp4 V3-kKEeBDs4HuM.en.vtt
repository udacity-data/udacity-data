00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
In this lesson, you learned about a number of

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.700
different aspects regarding the design of visualizations.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.250
You first learn about levels of measurement.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.904
Depending on the types of data you want to plot,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.445
qualitative or quantitative, discrete or continuous,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.804
there will be different plot types that are best suited for the job.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.879
Your choice of visual encodings such as position,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.375
color, and shape will depend on the types of data you plot.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.765
You will see this in action in the upcoming lessons.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.530
You also learned about design elements that can

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.620
interfere with the clarity and accuracy of your plots.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.129
By being mindful of chart junk, data-ink ratios,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.320
and life factors, you can ensure that

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.829
your visualizations present their messages at their best.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.170
While these concepts are most pertinent during

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.600
the creation of explanatory visualizations,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.710
your awareness of these issues will also be useful during exploration.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.780
This will ensure that you come up with

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.660
the proper conclusions before sharing them with others.
