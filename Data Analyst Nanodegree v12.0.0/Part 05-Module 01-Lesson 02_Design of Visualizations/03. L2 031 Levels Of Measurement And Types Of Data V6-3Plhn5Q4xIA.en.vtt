00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.629
In order to choose an appropriate plot for your data,

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.195
you need to understand the types of the data you have.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:14.345
One common method divide data into four data types: Nominal,

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:17.589
ordinal, interval and ratio.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.370
The first two are known as qualitative or categorical types while

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.330
the last two are known as quantitative or numeric types.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.779
Furthermore, quantitative types include a second kind of

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.740
classification: Discrete or continuous.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.395
Features that are categorical are those that act as non-numeric labels on the data.

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:42.685
Nominal data are pure labels without any natural ordering.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.890
Examples of this include things like,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.564
movie genre or country.

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:51.349
Ordinal variables are also labels but unlike

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.844
nominal variables these include an intrinsic ordering.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:57.710
Examples of this type of variable include,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.984
letter grade on a test or ranking at the end of a competition.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:06.010
While categorical variables might be recorded numerically,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.280
we should not make the mistake of performing numeric operations with them.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.890
For example, let's say that the rankings

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.530
above come from a list of the best books of the year.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.974
We wouldn't expect the goodness of the first and second place books combined to

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:23.530
equal that of the third place book or

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.400
that the second and third place books some of to the first place book.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.525
You can only say that first place is better than second place,

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.625
and second place is better than third,

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.644
but not by how much.

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:39.289
Knowing the difference between first second doesn't necessarily

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.250
tell you that the difference between second third will be the same.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.829
Quantitative data on the other hand,

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.700
take numerical values that allow for mathematical operations.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.620
For interval type data,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.500
differences between numeric values are meaningful.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.885
Examples of this type of variable include,

00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.840
year or temperature in Celsius.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.990
An increase or decrease of one point will

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.664
mean the same thing no matter what you have at each scale.

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:10.430
Ratio type data also allows for difference comparisons,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.099
but also requires an additional property.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.859
For a variable to be considered ratio type,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.525
there must be a meaningful zero point such that ratio judgments are meaningful.

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:24.485
Consider the earlier example regarding temperature in Celsius.

00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:26.600
Since temperature is interval,

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.155
the difference between five degrees and 10 degrees

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:32.265
is the same as that between 10 and 15 degrees.

00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:35.344
But Celsius is not a ratio type variable.

00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:38.090
You wouldn't say that 10 degrees is twice as hot as

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.125
five degrees or 15 degrees three times as hot as five.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:47.330
Examples of ratio type data include: the length of a document by word count,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.165
or measurement of mass in kilograms.

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:53.870
All quantitative variables, whether interval or ratio

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.189
type can also be classified as discrete or continuous.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.479
Discrete quantitative variables can only take on specific values,

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.704
while continuous variables can take on any value.

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.635
Year and word count are examples of discrete variables.

00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:12.349
They can only take on integer values.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.775
Temperature and mass are examples of continuous variables.

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:20.120
These variables can take on any number of decimal values,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.909
if we had instruments capable of recording them with that precision.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.799
Cut.
