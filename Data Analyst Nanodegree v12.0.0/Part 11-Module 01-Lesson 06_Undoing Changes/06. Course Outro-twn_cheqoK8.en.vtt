00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
We finally reached the end.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.704
Can you believe it?

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.935
Think back to your former self when you first started this course.

00:00:06.935 --> 00:00:08.248
The new and improved you,

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:10.115
now has Git superpowers.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:14.720
You can create a GIT repository from scratch, make commits,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.890
review the history of a repository, develop on branches,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.845
merge branches together and handle any merge conflicts,

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:24.850
and then revert and reset commits.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.130
Git and version control in general can be a challenging skill to acquire.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.590
But now you've done it.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.570
Congratulations.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.000
