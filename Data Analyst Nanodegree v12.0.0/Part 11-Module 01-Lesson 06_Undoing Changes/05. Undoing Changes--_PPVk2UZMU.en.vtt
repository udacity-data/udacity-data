We look that git commits dash dash amend flag to reword or update the most recent commit.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:10.039
We looked at the git revert command to undo a specific commit,

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.774
and we just looked at the git reset command to reset or erase changes,

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:17.574
but remember to be careful with that last one.

00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:22.000
Knowing how to fix mistakes definitely gave me the confidence to experiment,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.129
and hope you feel more confident making changes now that you know how undo them.
