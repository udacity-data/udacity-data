00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.464
One of the most common techniques for

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:08.960
understanding the relationship between two variables in regression,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.645
is the correlation coefficient you saw earlier.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:15.455
This part of the output provides a bunch of additional measures,

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:19.964
that are useful for understanding how well our line fits through the data.

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:24.745
One of the most common measures is this value here called the R squared value.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:27.935
Essentially, the closer this value is to 1,

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:29.614
the better our model fits.

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:31.820
And the closer the value is to zero,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.810
the worse the model fits.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.635
This value is actually just the square of the correlation coefficient. Hence the name.

00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:43.684
You will often hear the interpretation of the R-squared value,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.170
as the amount of variability in

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.829
the response that can be explained by your explanatory variable.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.960
So here, we can say that 67.8% of the variability in price,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.439
is explained by the area of the house.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:58.909
The remaining 33% of the variability,

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.734
is due to characteristics of the home that are not the area.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.069
In the next lesson,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:08.359
you will learn why using this value directly from the output, can be misleading.
