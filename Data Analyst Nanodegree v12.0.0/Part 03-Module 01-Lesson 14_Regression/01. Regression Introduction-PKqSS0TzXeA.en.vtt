00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.945
Welcome to this lesson on regression.

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:07.210
This lesson will be a starter for understanding

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:10.224
the types of problems that can be solved with regression techniques.

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.344
You will learn how to identify the problems that can be solved,

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.150
a bit about the algorithm and how it works under the hood,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.334
and how to apply this technique to data using Python.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.420
The skills gained in this lesson will be fundamental to understanding

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.000
later lessons on multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.
