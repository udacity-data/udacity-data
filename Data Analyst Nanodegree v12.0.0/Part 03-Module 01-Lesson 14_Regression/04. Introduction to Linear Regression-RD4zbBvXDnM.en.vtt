00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.770
The first type of regression we'll look at is called Simple Linear Regression.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.905
And in these cases,

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.655
we're comparing only two quantitative variables.

00:00:10.655 --> 00:00:12.955
And the most simple form of aggression,

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:16.740
we're interested in only of the relationship of two variables.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.570
This could be price versus sales,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.690
temperature versus humidity, height versus weight,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.155
or hours studying versus test grade.

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:28.340
A common way to visualize these relationships is with a scatter plot.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.485
The variable on this axis is called the response or dependent variable,

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:37.380
where the variable on this axis is called explanatory or independent variable.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.005
The response variable is the one that we're interested in predicting,

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.205
while the explanatory variable is used to predict the response.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:46.140
In the case of price versus sales,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.805
we'll likely have more control over the price,

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:52.650
where sales is something that we want to predict based on the price.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.780
Therefore, we would consider price to be

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.725
the explanatory variable and sales to be the response variable.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.970
In linear progression, the way that we do this is by fitting a line to the data.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.190
Before we get too far along with regression,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.450
let's take a closer look at

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.000
scatter plots and what is known as the correlation coefficient.
