00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.734
Before we get started,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.679
let's take a step back and look at the big picture of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.169
what machine learning is and how reggression fits into it.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.060
You might have heard of machine learning as it's currently a really hot topic,

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:17.384
but the truth is that it isn't really new.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:22.085
It's just a new way to package things that have actually existed for a really long time.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.539
Two primary branches of machine learning are called

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.494
supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:32.850
Supervised learning is where we use input data to predict a label for that data.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.250
Examples of this type of machine learning are using

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.134
credit card transaction data to predict fraudulent transactions,

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:44.054
or using customer financial data to predict the chance of a default on a loan,

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:48.090
or using neighborhood characteristics to predict home prices.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
Another large branch of machine learning is known as unsupervised machine learning.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.375
In this type of machine learning,

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.935
you're clustering together data based on common characteristics.

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.575
These data don't have labels like in supervised machine learning techniques.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:06.480
Common unsupervised problems include trying to group similar customer segments,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
or group documents that cover similar topics.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.555
There are other machine learning approaches but these are the two main branches.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:14.939
And as it turns out,

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.000
linear and logistic regression fall into the supervised machine learning branch.
