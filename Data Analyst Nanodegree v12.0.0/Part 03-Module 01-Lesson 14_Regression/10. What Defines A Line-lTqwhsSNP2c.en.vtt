00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.230
When we fit line to a set of points,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.610
we commonly define it by two values,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.794
an intercept and a slope.

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:12.089
The Intercept tells us the predicted value of

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.404
the response when the explanatory variable is zero.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:20.189
We commonly use this notation for the population and sample intercept values,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.770
pronounced beta knot for the parameter and B0 for the statistic.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.085
The slope tells us the predicted change in the response for

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:33.439
each additional one unit increase in the explanatory variable.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.269
Similarly, the notation for the population

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.856
and sample slope values are notated in this way,

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:42.704
pronounced as beta one for the parameter,

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:45.184
and B1 for the statistic.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:47.130
Once we've fit a line to these points,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.260
we define it with this equation.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:52.530
This point here at the beginning of the line is the intercept value,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.335
that is, where the x value is equal to zero.

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:59.250
And if we were to increase by one along the x-axis, like this,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.700
then the change along the y-axis in the line is the slope value,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.015
one last important note on notation.

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:07.739
Commonly, you will see y,

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.424
and Y-hat values like these in regression.

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:13.334
These actually notate two different things.

00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:17.129
Y-hat values define the values that we get from the fitted line,

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:20.515
but the y defines the actual data points.

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:24.254
So this value would be defined as y1, x1.

00:01:24.254 --> 00:01:26.000
But if we were to go to the line,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.099
we would define this as Y-hat_1, X1.

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.750
Now that you understand that there are two values that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.230
define a line and how they're represented,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.040
both in notation and visually, in the next video,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.950
you'll see how we actually figure out what line best

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.070
fits the points and exactly what best means.
