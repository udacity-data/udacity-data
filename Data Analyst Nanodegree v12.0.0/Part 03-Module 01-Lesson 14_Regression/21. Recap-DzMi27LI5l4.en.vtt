00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.299
In this lesson, you learned about

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.506
the math and programming aspects of fitting simple linear regression.

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:11.689
Additionally, you learned how to interpret

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.269
the coefficients of your regression model and how to

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.000
assess if your explanatory variable is doing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.339
a good job at allowing you to predict the response variable.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.739
Now that you have an understanding of

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.473
linear regression between two quantitative variables,

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:28.295
let's take this another step further by looking at how we can incorporate

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:32.700
more variables including both quantitative and categorical variables.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000
But more of this is in the next lesson.
