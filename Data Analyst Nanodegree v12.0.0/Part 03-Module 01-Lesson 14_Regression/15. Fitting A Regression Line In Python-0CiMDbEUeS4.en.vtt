00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
In this video, we'll be looking at fitting a linear model to our data in Python.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:06.934
We will be using the statsmodel library.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:09.089
I've loaded the necessary libraries we'll be using

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.125
here as well as loading the data set using pandas.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.329
It looks like if you don't have statsmodels installed,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.104
you'll have to install that before we can get started.

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.920
Here, I've done a pip install.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.545
At the end of this lesson,

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.380
you will be performing this process a few times on

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.960
different datasets to assure you are comfortable with this process,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.609
and the provided results.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.130
Before we fit our model,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.945
we need to make sure to add a column for our intercept.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.234
Unfortunately, statsmodels doesn't automatically do this,

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:43.109
and there are only rare cases where you will not want to add an intercept.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.774
A link discussing this topic is provided in the instructor notes below.

00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:52.289
Here, we are providing OLS method the Y and X variables.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.564
OLS stands for ordinary least squares,

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:56.905
as this is the method we want to use.

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:59.664
First, we provide our Y,

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:03.534
and then a list of the X variables.

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:06.489
We then fit the model with this,

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:10.009
and finally, we can store our results and look at a summary.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.785
In the remaining concepts,

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:13.479
we'll go through how to interpret some of

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.329
the most important information from this output.
