Okay, so now we can start the Roger Ebert review word cloud.

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:08.317
So the first thing you need,

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:09.949
the text from each of his reviews,

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.849
for each of the movies on the Rotten Tomatoes Top 100 Movies of All Time list.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.000
They live on his website.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.890
Lucky for you I've pre-gathered all of this text in the form of 100.txt files.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.109
I put them on this Udacity hosted web page

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.949
and you're going to download them all programmatically.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.734
Yes, you can point and click and download each file manually but that would take forever,

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.984
especially if someone else wants to reproduce your analysis.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.204
If they want to check your work, for example,

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:41.234
they can download all of the files with the execution of a few lines of code.

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:43.804
So downloading files from Internet programmatically

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:47.225
is best for scalability and reproducibility.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.420
In practice you really only need to know one thing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.380
to download files like this, Python's request library.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.375
Knowing a bit of HTTP aka

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:01.445
Hypertext Transfer Protocol will help you understand what's going on under the hood here.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:06.109
So next you'll learn the basics of HTTP along with Python's request library.
