00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:07.310
Remember, data wrangling can be an iterative process.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.049
Whether you're in the gather, assess,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.750
or clean phase, you can iterate on them.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.710
So you just gathered a bunch of data.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.253
For this lesson, I handled the assessing,

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:18.725
cleaning, then analyzing, and visualizing.

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:20.615
But at any point in that process,

00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:23.570
I could have stopped to gather more data.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.600
Maybe we wanted different data like scraping the actual average ratings,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.740
instead of these critic and audience score metrics.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.989
These are the percentage of reviewers that gave the movie a 70% rating or higher.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.050
We get a different take on the same question.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:42.000
Starting small and iterating is very okay.
