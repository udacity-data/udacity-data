00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
The first step of web scraping is getting the web page's data,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:05.429
which is stored in a format called,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.359
HTML, HyperText Markup Language.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.660
One way of getting the HTML is by saving it to your computer manually,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.984
going to your web page,

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:16.859
then to your browser's menu,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.039
and clicking save or hitting command or control

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.059
S. But that's not the best way to do it for data analysis.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.614
There are two better ways,

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:27.559
and they're both done programmatically,

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.104
which is best for scalability and reproducibility,

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.440
which is key in this case.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.575
Because we have 100 HTML files to access,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.810
and multiple people, i.e.,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.030
every student that takes this class is going to access them.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.439
Okay, so the first is actually downloading

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:45.460
the HTML file programmatically to your computer.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.549
Here's all the code you need.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.269
You'll learn how this code works under the hood later in the lesson,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.060
when you download files from the internet programmatically.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.670
This is just the code to download one file.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.800
To download all 100 files,

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.574
we just need to put this code in a loop.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:03.320
The second programmatic way to access

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.757
HTML data is done by not saving a file to your computer at all,

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:12.149
and simply working with the response content live in your computer's memory.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.635
You can use the BeautifulSoup HTML parser

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:17.170
to help you work with the response content directly.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.000
You're going to dive into this BeautifulSoup library shortly.
