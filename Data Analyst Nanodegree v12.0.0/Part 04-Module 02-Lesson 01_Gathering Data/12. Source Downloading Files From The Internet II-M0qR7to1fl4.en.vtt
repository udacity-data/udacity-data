00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Given this Ebert review URL's list,

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.040
the first thing to do is loop through it.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.294
Then, we'll get the HTTP response via request.get.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:13.279
On whatever URL, we are currently on the iteration of that loop.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.320
Then, the bit of code to open a file and write the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.545
response.content to that file is the same.

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:24.840
And that's it, we'll process the cell and this may take a bit of time to do,

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.359
downloading these files takes some time.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.454
It took my computer roughly five seconds and let's check the contents of this folder.

00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:36.085
And the're all of the text files.

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:40.935
There should be 88, and there are.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:46.219
12 movies in the top 100 Rotten Tomatoes list didn't have reviews on Roger Ebert's site.
