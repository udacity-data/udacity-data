00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.769
So the inspiration for our little project here,

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.089
was this Rotten Tomatoes top 100 movies of all time list. How do we get it.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.884
Rotten Tomatoes doesn't give us a file to download unfortunately.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:17.975
For this lesson, I'm just going to give it to you.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.535
Gathering can be complicated,

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:21.934
but it can also be extremely easy.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.649
Sometimes you are simply just given a file.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.549
I've pre-gathered this dataset with its four columns; rank, title, rating,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.295
and number of reviews, and it's 101 rows,

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:34.969
one for the headers and one for each of the top 100 movies.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.859
I put the data in a flat file called a TSV file which stands for tab separated values.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.394
There's a link for you to download it in the classroom.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:46.145
Picture this as me e-mailing this file to you,

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.305
or giving it to you on a thumb drive,

00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:52.280
or you accessing the file from your company's file storage system.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.740
So point and click and download it, and we'll move on.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.844
We don't need to do it programmatically in this case,

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:00.185
because we'll assume that this data is internal,

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.455
and can't be downloaded from the Internet.

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:06.000
You're going to learn about the structure of flat files next.
