Okay, so now for the cherry on top.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.099
Getting each movie's poster to add to our word cloud.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.969
So how are you going to get these images?

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.580
You could scrape the image URL from the HTML.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.899
But a better way to access them is through an API or application programming interface.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.750
Since each movie has its poster on its Wikipedia page,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.594
you can use Wikipedia's API.

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.039
At their simplest, APIs let you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.339
access data from the Internet in a reasonably easy manner.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.649
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram all have APIs.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.894
It doesn't have to be a company led thing though.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:37.150
There are tons of open source APIs.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.530
MediaWiki, which is a popular API for Wikipedia is open source.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.420
This is the API you'll be using in this lesson.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.265
I found APIs daunting for a long time,

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:49.090
but they don't have to be.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.000
You're going to learn how gathering data from APIs can actually be pretty simple.
