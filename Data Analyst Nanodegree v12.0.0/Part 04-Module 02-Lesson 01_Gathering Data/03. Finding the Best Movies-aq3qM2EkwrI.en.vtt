00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.084
It's Sunday night. You just had a nice meal,

00:00:03.084 --> 00:00:05.219
maybe some dessert, and you're on the couch with

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:08.184
some popcorn and you want to watch a movie.

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.165
How do you pick what to watch?

00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.059
Being a data driven person,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.705
I love to check the ratings and reviews on Rotten Tomatoes,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:18.510
which is a popular movie rating website.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.290
This list they have here is so useful.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.064
The Rotten Tomatoes top 100 movies of all time list.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:30.410
As written here, movies with 40 or more critic reviews are eligible for this list.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.640
That's critic reviews, so ratings from

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.219
regular movie watchers like you and me aren't included in these calculations.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.280
It's sorted by this adjusted score metric which combines

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.135
the rating and number of critic reviews for each movie to create this adjusted score.

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:48.479
The idea being that movies with fewer critic ratings have

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.324
an easier path to getting that 100% score or close to it.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:54.270
Let's scroll a bit here.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.390
Okay, so E.T., I've never actually seen

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.784
Steven Spielberg's 1982 masterpiece despite hearing lots about it.

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:07.295
It's currently 11th on this list with a 98% rating and 114 critic reviews.

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:11.370
Let's check it out. Okay, so there's that 98% rating.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.165
This number is a bit deceiving though.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.450
It's actually the Tomatometer score,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.680
which is the percentage of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.715
approved Tomatometer critics who have given the movie a positive review.

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:24.790
But okay, there's this audience score here, 72%.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.710
That metric wasn't included in that top 100 list.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.634
That's a pretty massive gap.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.725
Maybe this movie isn't that amazing.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:36.269
Also, wouldn't it be cool to compare this critic's score and also the audience score

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:41.409
for all of these movies to see which movie really truly is the best?

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.640
Also to find the worst best movie if you will.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.295
I'm picturing a scatterplot with four quadrants,

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:50.704
like this one, but with different axis labels and values.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:56.469
We'd have audience score on the horizontal axis and critics score on the vertical one.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.659
That would put amazing movies with

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.394
high audience and critics scores in the top right quadrant

00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:05.140
then critically underrated movies in the bottom

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.009
right quadrant with high audience scores and low critics scores,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.379
and critically overrated movies in the top

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.370
left with low audience scores and high critics scores.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.090
Also, I don't trust every single reviewer necessarily.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.875
One person I do though,

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:23.259
the late great Roger Ebert.

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.879
For lots of people,

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.659
Roger Ebert's was the only review they needed because he explained the movie in

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.759
such a way that they would know whether they would

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.969
like it or not, his opinion notwithstanding.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.120
Wouldn't it be neat if we had a word cloud for each of the movies in

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.390
that top 100 list with Roger Ebert's review text in that word cloud for each movie?

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.944
This cool little word cloud generator in Python can help us out.

00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:49.209
Having a word cloud for each movie would give us

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.895
a snapshot of what makes each movie great.

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:55.870
This word cloud library also has the ability to use stencils,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.365
so we could take the movie poster for each movie and surround it with

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:03.950
a stencil and then put the word cloud around the poster image.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.280
That'd be really cool. So, to create both of these visualizations,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.680
the data is in a few different spots and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.375
it will require some craftiness to gather it all,

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:14.289
but you can definitely do it.

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.844
This is actually going to be so awesome.

00:03:16.844 --> 00:03:19.180
I'm so excited for you to see the final products.
