00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
So now you've gathered the data to produce our second goal visualization,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.525
the Roger Ebert Review Wordcloud.

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:10.665
Next, we'd have to assess and clean the data.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.914
The second and third steps in the data wrangling process.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.957
This lesson is on gathering specifically though.

00:00:16.957 --> 00:00:21.515
So we'll stay focused and leave assessing and cleaning to lessons three and four ahead.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.652
I took care of both of these behind the scenes.

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:27.824
And the result of that is this master data frame here.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:31.024
Let's hop straight to the second final product here,

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.350
the word clouds themselves.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.649
And here's a sample of them. On the right, E.T.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.625
on the left, Inside Out.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:43.640
E.T. was ranked 11th and Inside out was ranked 8th on that top 100 list.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.494
I think this is so cool and I hope you do too.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:49.949
It's definitely a unique snapshot into the movie's plot and what

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.410
makes it great according to arguably the best film critic that ever lived.

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.059
These movie posters pasted within the stencil

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.390
of this word cloud really do add some flash.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.954
Let's check out a few more.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:04.129
Here are some older classics.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.724
On the left, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, ranked 36.

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:10.719
And on the right, Casablanca, ranked 16th.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.855
The colors here look so cool.

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:16.665
I've never seen Rear Window but just from this word cloud and knowing

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:20.780
Alfred Hitchcock is known for thriller or horror-type movies,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.894
you can see danger and murder here.

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:25.164
This word cloud has me itching to watch it.

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:28.960
Feel free to pause the video and take a look through these if you'd like.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.554
And here are two more.

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:33.405
Wonder Woman and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:37.394
Wonder Woman ranked 46th and Star Wars ranked 62nd.

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:40.515
And two more, Lala Land and Finding Nemo,

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:44.045
ranked 86th and 73rd respectively.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.195
I can't get over the colors, they're just so pretty.

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.864
Data visualization can be informative,

00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:51.640
but it can also be art.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.780
So there are lots more of these word clouds.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.930
So I'll put them all in a folder for you to download and check out if you're interested.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.750
These word clouds required gathering data from two different sources.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.810
Downloading files from the internet, i.e.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.944
the Roger Ebert review text files and accessing data from an API, i.e.

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:11.979
the movie poster URLs.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.489
And this data was in two formats,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.000
.txt and Json. Again, great work.
