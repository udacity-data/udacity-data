00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Okay. So since the review URL is online two,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.839
we'll just use readline again to read the next line in the file.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.934
And again there is that newline character that we don't want at the end of the string,

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.290
so we'll slice that off like above.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.655
And then to read the rest of the lines in the text file,

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.710
we just use file.read.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.785
Then we add those variables in the body of this loop to a dictionary.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:26.280
Then append that dictionary to df_list.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.790
After completing that loop,

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.119
then we can convert that list of dictionaries to

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.429
a Pandas dataframe and then we process the cell and that should be it.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.109
Before we run this code though,

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.269
we have to import Pandas as the alias PD.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.345
And with the columns parameter specifying the order of the columns title,

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.539
then review URL, then review text,

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.000
our newly created dataframe is displayed below.
