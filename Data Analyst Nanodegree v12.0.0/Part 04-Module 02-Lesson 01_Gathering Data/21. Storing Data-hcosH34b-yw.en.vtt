00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.480
So, you've got all of the pieces of data you need for our two visualizations.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.580
In its own Pandas dataframe.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.455
What do you do with the data in that dataframe now that you're done?

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:15.289
You want to save or store it somehow.

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.875
Two popular options.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.089
Saving to a database,

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.800
and saving to a file.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.905
For tabular data like we have here, both files,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:26.630
like CSD files, in databases are used a ton.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.529
The right solution depends on your dataset

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.155
and the infrastructure you use in your daily work.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.899
Saving to a CSV file is easy,

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.634
and is probably the best solution for a simple dataset like this one.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.609
You'll learn how to do this next.

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.405
But you're also going to learn how to load the data into a database.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:46.675
They're fast, they scale well as your data grows in size,

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:50.214
and you can ask them questions using languages like SQL.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:55.660
They're very powerful, and database skills are hugely in demand in today's workplace.
