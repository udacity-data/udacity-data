Here's one of the html files you will use in this lesson.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.644
The ET rotten tomatoes page.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:10.649
And if we scroll, we can see its structure as Cameron described.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.130
One thing that blew my mind when I first started learning about

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.410
html files is that they are not some sort of magic fancy internet file.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.579
They are just like any regular file and can be saved locally and if you drag this into

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.219
a browser the web page will display as if you

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.654
accessed it through a regular URL. Here's what that looks like.

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:30.150
In the Sublime Text Editor,

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.530
you can drag this mini file symbol to your browser. That's still crazy to me.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.620
All this code in text on the left here generates the web page on the right in a browser.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:41.659
That's the browser's job.
