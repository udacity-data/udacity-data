00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Reading a tab separated values file into a Panda's data frame is

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.355
very similar to reading a CSV or a Comma Separated Values file.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.019
We still use read_csv,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.769
then put in the path to our file, which is bestofrt.tsv,

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.894
then the only difference is including the set parameter,

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.843
which we want to be a tab, which is \t.

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:24.875
It will process the cell and display our data frame.

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:26.410
And there it is.
