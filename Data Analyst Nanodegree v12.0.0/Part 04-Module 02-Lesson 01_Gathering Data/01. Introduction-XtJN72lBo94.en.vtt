00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.745
You've reached lesson two of our data wrangling course.

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:11.000
In lesson one, we walk through the whole wrangling process from gathering,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.785
to assessing, to cleaning data,

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:14.824
and iterating if necessary.

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:19.219
In the next three lessons, you're going to dive deeper into each step of the process.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.799
First, you're going to master gathering data.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.147
Depending on your project,

00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:24.934
gathering data varies a lot.

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:29.210
Data you need may be spread across dozens of sources and in different file formats,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.465
which might be the most challenging part of working with data.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.030
Not analyzing, not visualizing,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.679
not even building fancy machine-learning models, simply gathering.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.854
It's also glossed over in most data wrangling courses where

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:46.564
complete datasets are just provided for you. Not here.

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:50.390
In this lesson, you'll gather real data from several different sources and

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.039
file formats while learning about each and how to handle them using Python.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.339
You'll combine them all to create a master dataset which we'll then use

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.240
to answer interesting questions and produce stunning visualizations.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.180
You're going to leave this lesson with the gathering skills required

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.720
for the vast majority of your wrangling projects in the future.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.775
So let's do this. This is going to be fun,

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.490
challenging, and is going to require a bit of creativity.
