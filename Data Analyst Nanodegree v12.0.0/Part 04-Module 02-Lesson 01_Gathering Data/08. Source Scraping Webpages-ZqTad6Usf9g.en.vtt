00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.549
All right. So we want to grab this audience score here to add to our data

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.955
set and number of audience reviews to match our number of critic reviews.

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:15.254
Unfortunately, Rotten Tomatoes hasn't made this easily accessible for us.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.635
One way we can get these pieces of data though, web scraping.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:23.465
Web scraping is a fancy way of saying extracting data from web sites using code.

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:27.769
It's actually one of the first magical things that drew me to programming.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.704
Behind the scenes though, web scraping is actually quite simple.

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:37.295
The data that lives on web pages is called HTML, HyperText Markup Language.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:41.270
It's made up of these things called tags which give the web page structure.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.670
Because HTML code is just text,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.425
these tags and the content within them can be accessed using parsers,

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.019
and in Python, there is an awesome one called Beautiful Soup.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.750
We can download HTML and access it offline,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.804
or we can do it in real time over the Internet.

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:58.250
For this lesson, we're going to download

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.325
the HTML files and parse them using Beautiful Soup.

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:05.000
Before we do though, let's explore the structure of HTML files.
