00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.349
Congrats. You've reached the end of our lesson on gathering data,

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.299
the first step of the data wrangling process.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.185
You gather data from multiple different sources,

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:14.535
you extract the data from a file handed to you,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.484
you scrape data off of a web page,

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.195
downloaded files from the internet,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.480
and accessed data from an API,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.245
then put it all in a database.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.125
And all of this data was in completely different formats: TSV,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.359
HTML, TXT, JSON, then eventually a database.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.649
Becoming a master data gatherer requires a bunch of skills since data

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.119
comes in so many different formats and from so many different sources in practice.

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.114
So keep up the awesome work.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:43.140
This stuff's not easy.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.429
In the next lesson,

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.000
you're going to put on your detective cap and assess a completely new exciting dataset.
