00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.230
But now we're going to learn a trick that would change your

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.120
answer from no to yes.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.430
And that trick relates to features.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.490
So far we assumed that we input our data features, x and y,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.470
into this magic big box called support vector machine and outcome is a label.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.790
Where label's either a blue circle or a red x.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.130
So we're going to pick a feature that is helpful for my example here.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.100
It's going to be x square plus y square.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.330
Why that?

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.940
You'll see in a minute.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.410
But I can convince you that it's easy to compute x square plus y

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.580
square from x and y.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.530
So, now I have a three-dimensional input space.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.670
It's hard to draw over here.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.350
And I can run the exact same algorithm on these three

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.580
features that I previously ran on the two features.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.925
And here's my $100,000 question.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:55.660
Do support vector machines work by now?

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.340
Or put differently, is this new situation linearly separable?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.239
By which I mean, can we find the line or a hyperplane that

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.800
separates the axes from the circles if this is now our feature space?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.340
It's going to be a trick question.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.800
It's a hundred thousand dollar questions which means if you get it right

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.129
I won't give you a hundred thousand dollars.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.930
But give it a try.
