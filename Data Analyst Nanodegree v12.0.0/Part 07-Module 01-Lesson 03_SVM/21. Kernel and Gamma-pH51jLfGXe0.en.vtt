00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.602
All right, so let's take a moment and

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:06.307
just explicitly talk about parameters in machine learning.

00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:10.920
And parameters are arguments that you pass when you create your classifier.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.780
So this is before fitting, and they can make

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.720
a huge difference in the decision boundary that your algorithm arrives at.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.370
So what are some of the parameters for an SVM?

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.590
Well, we've talked about one already, which is the kernel, and there

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.900
are two more that we're going to talk about right now, which are C and γ.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.070
And that was the difference between these two SVMs that I

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.040
showed you just a minute ago, is they had different kernels, so the one on

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.560
the left was a linear kernel and the one on the right was an rbf kernel.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.760
And as it happened, I was also monkeying around with γ here.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.030
If you don't monkey around with γ,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.640
they'll actually look much more similar than this.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.600
So the γ in this case happened to be a 1,000.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.150
So here's a quiz for you, a reason for you to try some stuff on your own.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.302
Which of the following SVMs do you get when you use the parameters,

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:07.635
kernel is a linear kernel and the γ is set to 1.0?

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:10.032
So remember before, it was 1000, so

00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:13.810
now we're bringing down our γ by three orders of magnitude.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.470
Let me give you a few options.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.625
Which one do you think is the linear kernel with a γ of 1.0?
