00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.520
What you'll find when you start to poke around, either at the code or

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.100
at the documentation, is that a large value of

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.400
C means that you're going to get more training points correct.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.290
So what that means in practice is that you get the more intricate

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.850
decision boundaries with the larger values of C where it

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.580
can wiggle around individual data points to try to get everything correct.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.200
But at the cost of something that,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.820
that could be a little bit more complex than you liked it.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.340
Figuring out exactly how much you want a straight decision.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.050
Figuring out how much you want to have a smooth decision boundary versus one

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.720
that gets things correct is of course part of the artistry of machine learning.
