00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.630
What this line does that the other ones don't do, it maximizes the distance to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.060
the nearest point, and it does this relative to both classes.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.670
It's a line that maximizes the distance to the nearest points in either class,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.320
that distance is often called margin.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.590
If you go to a machine learning party, and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.430
everybody talks about support vector machines.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.383
It's really good to know the word margin because it is the thing that is

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:28.030
being maximized.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.946
The margin is the distance between the line and

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:34.260
the nearest point of either of the two classes.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.510
Is this because it's more simple? It's in line with an axis.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.020
Did I just pick the line at random or is something else going on over here?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.460
Is there some criterion that would make you pick this line,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.500
over the other two lines that I gave you
