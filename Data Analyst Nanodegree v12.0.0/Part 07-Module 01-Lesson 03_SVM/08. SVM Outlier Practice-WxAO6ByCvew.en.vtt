00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.110
So, as you dive into the code of SVMs,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.160
it is a piece of software that truly ignores outliers.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.000
So, just to practice this, in this example over here of red data and

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.580
blue data, where there seems to be exactly an outlier,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.780
say you're willing to ignore an outlier.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.290
Which separated line would you pick?

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.560
Just choose one of the three.
