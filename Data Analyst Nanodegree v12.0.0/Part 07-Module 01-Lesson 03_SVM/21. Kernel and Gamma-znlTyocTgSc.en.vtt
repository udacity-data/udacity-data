00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.040
So, I hope you said this one.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.320
So there's a few ways that you could've answered this.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.100
You could've just coded it up with a linear kernel and a gamma of 1.0.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.230
You would've found something that looks like this.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.140
Another thing you could've done is you could've looked at these two

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.230
decision boundaries and said, well these are both wiggly.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.000
And, I know that a linear kernel is only going to give me

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.750
a linear decision boundary.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.840
It's always going to look like that
