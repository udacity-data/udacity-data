00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.230
Welcome back.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.990
I hope you were able to get your support vector classifier working, but

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.840
in case you need a little nudge, let me show you what I did.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.990
So, starting from the starter code,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.150
there's only actually two lines of code that I need to add.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.390
The first one is that I have to fit my classifier, and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.995
I have to fit it on the training table.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.390
The first one is that I have to fit my classifier, and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.435
I have to fit it on the training data, so

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.920
that means passing features_train, and labels_train to my fit function.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.040
Then, the second thing is making a list of predictions.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.050
So, I store to a list named pred, and that's just

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.390
the familiar predict function that we've seen with the Naive Bayes classifier.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.190
Remember, when you're making predictions,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.850
you're only going to be passing one set of information, now, the features.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.740
Because the labels are what you're trying to predict.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.610
And also, of course,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.480
you want to do it on the test dataset, not on the training dataset.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.890
So, with two lines like this you should be able to get your SVM up and running.
