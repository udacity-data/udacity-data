00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.570
And I would say something
else is going on here.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.410
What this line does that
the other ones don't do,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.710
it maximizes the distance
to the nearest point.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.290
This is relative to both classes,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.970
this line maximizes the distance to
the nearest point in either class.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.020
That distance is often called margin.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.312
If you go to a machine
learning party and

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.880
everybody talks about support vector
engines, it's really good to know

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.490
the word margin because it is
the thing that is being maximized.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.360
The margin is the distance
between a line and

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.480
the nearest point of
either of the two classes.
