00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.190
So hey, that was great.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.030
I hope you guys had fun programming all this.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.770
Let's get back to some more theory.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.230
I'm going to give you a very tricky data set.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.200
There's a couple of pluses and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.090
I've clustered around the origin of this coordinate system, x and y.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.890
And there's a whole bunch of o's that lie more in the periphery.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.190
And give what you've learned so far.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.710
Do you think support vector machines give you a good answer here?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.240
Will support vector machines work?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.460
YES or NO?
