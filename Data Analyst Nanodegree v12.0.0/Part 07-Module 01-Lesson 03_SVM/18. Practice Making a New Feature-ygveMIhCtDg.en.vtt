00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.740
So let's practice this a little bit.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.740
So here's a data set that is clearly not linearly separable.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.120
So you won't be able to find a line that separates the x's from the circles,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.050
within the x-y coordinate system.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.820
But now I'm going to ask you to add one more feature.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.040
And that feature should make it linearly separable.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.770
And I'll give you some possibilities.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.240
x square plus y square,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.800
as before, the absolute value of x or the absolute value of y.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.260
Obviously, the absolute value just takes out the minus sign.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.130
Take one of those.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510
I can tell you one of those actually makes linearly separable.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.962
And it's a trick question, it's hard.
