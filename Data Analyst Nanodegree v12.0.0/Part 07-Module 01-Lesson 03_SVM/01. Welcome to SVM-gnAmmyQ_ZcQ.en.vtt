00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; So this is the unit on support vector machines, or SVMs.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.440
&gt;&gt; Support vector machines are a really popular algorithm.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.800
They have lots and lots of uses.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.190
&gt;&gt; And it's actually so young that I was personally around when

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.790
Vladimir Vapnik invented the support vector machine.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.097
It was a big surprise to the community that someone could find an algorithm that

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:20.210
is so phenomenally good.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.950
It's really a great algorithm.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.740
&gt;&gt; So let's get started.
