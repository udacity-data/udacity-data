00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; So, we've reached the end of support vector machines, and

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.650
I think we learned quite a bit here.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.430
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.610
At the end of Naive Bayes we started a list of all the different things that we

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.670
should be thinking about when picking an algorithm.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.450
We've learned a lot about support vector machines that now we can add on to

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.480
that list.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.830
&gt;&gt; Yes. So they work really well in complicated domains where there is

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.250
a clear margin of separation.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.280
And they don't perform so well in very large data sets,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.145
because the training time happens to be cubic in the size of the data set.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.780
They also don't work well with lots and lots of noise.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.470
So when the class are very overlapping you have to count independent evidence.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.550
That's where then a Naive Bayes classifier would be better.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.590
&gt;&gt; So again, it comes back to the data set that you have and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.780
the features that you have available.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.010
If you have a really big data set, if you have lots and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.540
lots of features, SVMs right of the box might be very slow.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.670
And they might be prone to overfitting to some of the noise in your data.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.600
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yes, so, just test it out on the testing set.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.880
See how it how it performs.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.880
And then you're ready to go.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.630
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.230
So, I think we're ready to go on to the next lesson?

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.290
&gt;&gt; Great.
