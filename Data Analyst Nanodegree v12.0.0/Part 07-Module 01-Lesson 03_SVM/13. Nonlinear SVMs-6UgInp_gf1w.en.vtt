00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.310
Okay, now I want to show you something really crazy,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.200
that's going to make it immediately clear how cool SVMs can be.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.960
So, what I'm showing you here are two different SVMs,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.520
this one you just made, and this is one that I just made.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.560
You don't know how yet, but

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.610
we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.580
Look at how intricate this decision boundary is,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.220
you have little pockets and you have little peninsulas that reach out.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
You can see an SVM can do some really complicated shapes to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.510
the decision boundary, sometimes even more complicated than you want.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.380
So, let's go talk to Sebastian again.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
And he has some pretty interesting insights as to

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.050
how this is coming out of a classifier.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.370
Remember, the SVM is a classifier that's built on giving us linear separation,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.830
so how on earth can it give us this incredibly non-linear decision boundary?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.330
Well, that's something Sebastian's going to explain to you now.
