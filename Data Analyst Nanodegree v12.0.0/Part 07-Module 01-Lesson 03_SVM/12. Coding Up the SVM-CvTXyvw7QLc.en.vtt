00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.840
Okay, so I bet you know what I'm going to ask you now.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.130
I'm going to ask you to code it up yourself.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.110
If you guessed that, you'd be correct.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.730
so, let me show you what I did,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.600
and then you're going to be able to make a SVM, just like I did.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.220
So, what I would suggest, is you head back to Google, just like I did,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.330
find this page on the Support Vector Machines' documentation from scikit-learn.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.380
Remember, that if you scroll down just a little bit,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.350
you'll find this Classification section.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.480
And, down here, is the example code that I used to get my code running.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.800
Now, there's one little hiccup, one little catch.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.740
In exactly how we created the classifier, right here.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.060
So, what I'm going to do is actually get you started with this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.340
line and this line.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.680
And, you'll see that there's a little difference in the way

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.300
that I wrote my code.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.827
We're going to be talking about this a lot in the next few videos.

00:00:55.827 --> 00:01:01.468
But now it's your job to fit, and make predictions using your classifier.

00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:05.319
And then, the last thing that I want you to do is to print out the accuracy of

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.430
your classifier, the way that we did in Naive Bayes.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.532
remember, Naive Bayes the number to beat was about 88.4%.

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:15.594
So, there's, there's an interesting question.

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:16.353
Is an SVM, or

00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:20.770
Naive Bayes doing a better job of classifying your terrain in this example?
