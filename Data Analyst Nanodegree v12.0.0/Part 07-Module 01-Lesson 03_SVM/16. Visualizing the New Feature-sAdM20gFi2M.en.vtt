00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.930
If our support vector machine learns the class x square plus y square.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.280
Let's call this new feature over here z.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.730
So, we know that z equals x square plus y square.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.530
And we're trying to learn a hyperplane between x, y and z.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.440
z is always nonnegative because of the distance to the origin.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.560
And magically, for all the red points, the distance to the origin is small.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.850
And for all the blue circles, distance to the origin is large.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.540
So we show the exact same data in this new projection of x and z, omitting y.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.780
I find that all the Xs have a small value of z.

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:44.290
Whereas all the circles have a larger value of z.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.340
And just to understand this.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.170
To really get this.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.200
z measures the distance to the origin.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.140
So here's a small z, here's a small z, here's a small z, here's a small z.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.060
And for the blue circles, the distance is large, as you can see over here.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.365
So if I remap the data into this new coordinate system with the z,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.170
you find all the blue circles have a large value for

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.000
z and all the red Xs have a small value for z.
