00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.370
Now I can draw the decision boundary, this time in scikit-learn, and voila.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.780
This is what it looks like.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.082
So, you can see immediately, where before in Naive Bayes,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:14.220
we had something that was a little bit, little bit curvy maybe.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.040
Our SVM decision boundary is now perfectly straight.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.420
And of course, this is the line that's going to give us the maximum margin

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.070
between the decision boundary and any misclassified points, so

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.790
the points on either side.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.730
So, just to make that a little bit more illustrated on this particular example,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.550
that's, that means that it's going to have,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.450
it's going to maximize all of these distances here.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.040
The points that are nearby the decision boundary, it's going to try and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.000
find a decision boundary where all of these little orange lines are as big as

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.570
we can make them.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
That means that there's as much separation between the two classes as possible.
