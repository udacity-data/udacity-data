00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.790
And just as before, it's the middle one.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.390
There's a really large margin to the blue data set, but

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.270
a small margin to the x over here.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.740
So it doesn't really maximize the margin to both data sets, just that's the one.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.129
And the same is true for the line on the right side.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.080
So the reason why we pick the one in between is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.320
it seems to be most robust to classification errors.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.450
If you pick a line that's really close to existing data, then a small amount of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.180
noise would make the label over here flip and it feels not very robust.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.330
So the inside of support vector machine

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.855
is to maximize robustness of your result.

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:41.210
And that makes them really great, so let's practice this.
