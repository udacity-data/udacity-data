00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.359
So, that was easy.

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:02.630
Let me do this again.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.290
Here's a new data set.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.050
And, I give you three lines again.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.010
This line over here, this one over here, and this one over here.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.620
Check the line that you think best separates the data.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.450
Obviously, all three of them seem to separate the data, but one is the best.
