00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.580
And the answer is the absolute value of x, and I can prove it to you.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.740
If you were to show the absolute value of x, then it can't be anything negative.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.920
And all the points here get moved from the negative side to the positive side.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.280
So, this point in particular over here becomes this point here.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.110
Gone are these.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.640
This point over here becomes this point over here.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.460
So this is how it looks like if you look near all the points to the absolute

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.200
value of X coordinate system.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.630
You just flip them over.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.390
And if you look at this diagram,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.630
what you find is that there is now a beautiful, perfect linear separation.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.602
And if you ask yourself, how did the linear separation look in

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:50.528
the original space of x and y is effectively something like that.

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:54.516
It is non-linear because it has this inflection point over here.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.500
That's non-trivial to see, but

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.010
as you look at this, I hope you get that adding this one new non-linear feature

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.950
makes support vector machine linear separate the Xs from the circles.
