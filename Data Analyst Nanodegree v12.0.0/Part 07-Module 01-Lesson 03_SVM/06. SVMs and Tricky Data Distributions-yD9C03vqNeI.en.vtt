00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.930
Now I tricked you,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.260
it's actually this line over here and you might have gotten this right.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.780
Now this does maximize the margin, in some sense to all the data points.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.080
But it makes a classification error.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.510
The red x is on the wrong side of the green line.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.830
Whereas in this case over here, all the points are classified correctly.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.620
Support vector machine puts first and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.040
foremost the correct classification of the labels, and then maximize the margin.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.990
If we didn't care about correct classification,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.350
this line back here has an even larger margin to all the training examples.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.280
That's obviously the wrong line.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.930
So for support vector machines, you are trying to classify correctly, and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.020
subject to that constraint, you maximize the margin.
