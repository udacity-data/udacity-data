00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.580
And I would argue it's this one over here.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.370
because this one truly maximizes the margin to those points,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.100
ignoring the outlier.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.210
Whereas the one over here has a smaller margin to those points.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
So this would've been the correct answer over here.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.740
But the thing to learn is that SVM is actually somewhat robust to outliers.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.340
And it somehow mediates the attempt to find the maximum margin separator and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.730
the ability to ignore outliers.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.195
Obviously as a tradeoff, and the parameters of the SVM as we'll see,

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.618
determine how willing it is to achieve new outliers.
