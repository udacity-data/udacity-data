00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.029
&gt;&gt; And, the answer is?

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.410
&gt;&gt; The answer is, all of the above.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.130
Any of these in different types of combinations, can make you more or

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.360
less prone to over fitting.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.120
And, this is a lot of the artistry of machine learning

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.480
is tuning these parameters.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.270
So, you're not over fitting your data.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.780
&gt;&gt; But, we will learn techniques for

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.180
which we can automatically detect overfitting, where you have a test set.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.650
Absolutely.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.220
&gt;&gt; Okay, at least for now, play with those parameters and see what happens, and

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.510
see how the output varies depending on how we set those parameters
