00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.510
And, I would say the answer is yes.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.960
Here is the line.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.270
And, what's really interesting,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.170
this line over here, in the original data, corresponds to a circle.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.149
The circle of equal distance to the origin in the coordinates system.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.740
So, as we added this new feature,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.250
and I picked one that I really wanted to pick here.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.490
As we added this new feature, we're able to use support vector

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.480
machine to learn a nonlinear decision surface in the form of a circle.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.400
That is quite amazing.
