00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.190
So sometimes for

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.570
support vector machines, it seems impossible to do the right job.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.108
For example, you might have a data set just like this,

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:15.060
in which clearly no decision surface exists that would separate the two classes.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.370
You can think of the point down here as an outlier.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.850
So my question for you is, what do you want support vector machines to do?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.110
Should they give up if there's no decision surface to be found,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.490
should they give you a random result, or should they do the best they can?

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:36.630
Well, it's not clear what best means, but try to find the decision surface that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.870
best describes the data despite the fact you can't linearly separate them.
