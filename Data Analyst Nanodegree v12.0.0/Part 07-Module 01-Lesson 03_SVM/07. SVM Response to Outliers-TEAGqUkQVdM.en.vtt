00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.130
And, you know, the truth telling, we don't want it to give up

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.490
because then most of the time it would just give up, we didn't know what to do.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.780
Something random is even worse.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.990
The best you can might be to make a decision boundary just like this and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.970
just denote the effected one point on the other side.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.490
And, in fact, support vector machines are good enough to really do that.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.250
They often find the decision boundary that maximizes the clearance to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.930
both data sets.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.100
And tolerate at the same time individual outliers, as shown over here.
