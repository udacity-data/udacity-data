00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.420
And based on what you've learned so far I would say no is the correct answer.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.430
There is just no good linear hyperplane or

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.470
linear separator between these two classes.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.950
Or put differently, it's really hard to draw a line between these two classes.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.020
But in reality, the answer is yes.
