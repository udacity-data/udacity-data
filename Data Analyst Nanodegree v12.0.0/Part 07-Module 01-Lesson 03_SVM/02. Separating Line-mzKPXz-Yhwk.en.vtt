00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.719
So, let's talk about an algorithm called SVM,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.750
which is short for Support Vector Machines.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.180
Why someone would call an algorithm as machine, I have no clue,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.820
it was invented by a Russian, but it's a very popular algorithm.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.700
At first approximation, what Support Vector Machines do is find a separating

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.730
line, or more generally called a hyperplane, between data of two classes.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.850
So, suppose we have some data of two different classes.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.522
Support Vector Machine is an algorithm that takes this data as an input, and

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:42.250
outputs a line that separates those classes, if possible.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.620
Let me you give you three lines.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.580
In each line is a little check mark.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.100
Which line do you think separates the data?
