00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome to the mini project for support and vector machines.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.740
We'll be tackling the same topic that we did for naive Bayes which is,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.480
can you identify the author of an email based on the words that are used in

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.120
the text of that email.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.130
In the second part of the project we'll also dig into the parameters of

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.760
the SVM a little bit more.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.200
You had some practice gamma and C.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.510
And now we're going to go in and play around with those parameters and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.550
see how it speeds up the, the training time or the prediction time of the SVM

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370
and how it affects the accuracy of the SVM as well.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.980
So let's get started.
