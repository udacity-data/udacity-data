00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.700
And the correct answer is all the above and even more.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.689
And the place that I found that was right here.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.350
So I read down the documentation page a little bit and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.130
I see that the kernel is one of the parameters.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.030
And then I read this little statement that says it can be linear, poly, rbf,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.430
sigmoid, precomputed, or a callable.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.120
So, of course, all of these are correct answers.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.740
The one that gave us the straight line in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.290
the first example was the linear kernel.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.080
And in general, that's what linear kernels are going to do.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.090
They're going to draw a straight line.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.200
The one that gave us this crazy squiggly decision boundary,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
that was using an rbf kernel.
