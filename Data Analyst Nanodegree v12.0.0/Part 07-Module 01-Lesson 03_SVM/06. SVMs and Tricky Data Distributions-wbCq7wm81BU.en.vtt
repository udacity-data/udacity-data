Suppose this over here is your data.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.160
Which of the two lines do you think maximize the margin and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.880
would be the correct result of a support vector machine?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.260
Warning, this question is tricky.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.480
It's either this line over here or this line over here.
