00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.150
A lot of times you'll be working
with projects that require

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.030
different library versions or
different versions of python even.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.580
In my experience and in many other
people's' it's really difficult to get

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.370
all these versions to play
nicely together on one computer.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.220
To solve this problem we use virtual
environments managed with libraries such

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.000
as Virtualenv.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.970
Virtual environments let you
separate libraries required by

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.530
different projects, so
you can avoid conflicts.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.720
If you're working with data though,
Anaconda is the way to go.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.900
Anaconda is a distribution of libraries
and software specifically built for

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.560
data science.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.380
It comes with Conda, a package and

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.310
environment manager that will make
your life a thousand times better.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.320
Now I'll show you a bit
about using Conda.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.280
I generally create a new environment for
each project I start,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.770
this way I can keep the necessary
package versions separate.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.070
For example if I want to start
a new project using Python 3.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.820
Which you should be using for
all new projects,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.892
I can create an environment for it.

00:01:02.892 --> 00:01:09.468
Type in conde create,
give it a name, tea_facts.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.244
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:16.588
It's a bot that tweets
facts about tea and

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:20.690
the python version, three and enter.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.947
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:27.797
This will create the environment for me.

00:01:27.797 --> 00:01:34.976
Now, I can enter the environment
like so, source activate tea_facts.

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:37.560
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
This is the command on Mac in Linux,
on Window it's just activate.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.110
Now I'm in the environment,
you can see the name in the prompt.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.220
And you can see here
the packages that are installed,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.300
these are just the default packages.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.100
Now I can start installing
what I want for this projects.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.990
Let's install Numpy Pandas, for working
with the t data and matplotlib for

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.539
making visualization.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:11.539
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:20.193
Then I'll start notebooks which
I like to use to develop code.

00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:30.193
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.910
And again looking at
the installed packages.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.940
I have all these ready to use for
my project.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.620
And these are separated
from other environments, so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.200
I won't run into any
conflicting version issues.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.940
Okay, now it's your turn to learn how
to use Conda for your own projects,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.300
because that thing will take
around 30 minutes up to an hour.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.910
Okay, have fun.
