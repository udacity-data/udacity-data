00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.480
In this course, you will make use of two Python Visualization Libraries.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.775
Matplotlib and Seaboard.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.660
You will also make use of plotting functions built into the pandas library,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.835
which is a general data analysis package not explicitly just for data visualization.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:23.670
Often, when choosing a tool to work with,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.895
there's a trade-off between flexibility and productivity.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:30.975
On one end, you have a tool that has a high amount of flexibility.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.829
Matplotlib falls on this end of the spectrum.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.140
The versatility of Matplotlib,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.145
allows it to be used for nearly any kind of visualization you care to create.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.385
But this versatility, can come with a lot of verbosity.

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:46.489
There are some common plots like bar charts,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.370
that require a large amount of code to be written.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:53.390
The fact that you sometimes need to be very specific about how plots are

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.384
created can make it hard to quickly explore your data with matplotlib alone.

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:00.545
If you're looking to be productive,

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.980
and need to be generating many plots with little code,

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.369
Libraries like seaborne and Pandas can come in handy.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.230
These libraries contain a lot of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.030
convenience functions to quickly generate plots of your data.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.585
However, the plot types afforded by these libraries are not exhaustive.

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:21.289
So on their own, they're not as flexible as matplotlib.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.055
Together, the strengths of these libraries are complementary.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:27.620
For the most part, you can expect to use Pandas and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.935
Seaboard to perform initial explorations of your data.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:34.820
You may then want to use matplotlib to customize your plots,

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.369
or generate plots not covered by these other libraries.
