00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:07.410
Hi there. I'm Mike.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.460
I'm Josh.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.910
We would like to welcome you to this course on data visualization.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.100
Data visualization is vital in multiple areas of the data analysis process.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.725
Two main topics are covered in this course.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.590
Exploratory data visualizations are used to understand

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.579
the structure of your data faster than statistics would be able to load.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.159
This type of visualization is used once you are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.980
ready to start investigating your gathered data.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.460
Explanatory data visualizations, on the other hand,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.799
are created at the end of your analysis.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.824
This type of visualization is used to convey your findings to others or to tell a story.

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:47.344
This course will go over more than just how to code to create your visualizations.

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:50.869
You'll also learn about the design of visualizations from

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.594
choosing the right plot type to selecting appropriate variable encoding.

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:58.144
You will learn to create visualizations that are clear not just for you,

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.065
but also for others.

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:05.435
Data visualization is probably my favorite part of the data analysis process.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:10.189
It is always exciting to observe visualizations that generate new insights.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.810
By going through this course,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.100
you'll be able to use data visualization techniques to enhance your data analysis work.
