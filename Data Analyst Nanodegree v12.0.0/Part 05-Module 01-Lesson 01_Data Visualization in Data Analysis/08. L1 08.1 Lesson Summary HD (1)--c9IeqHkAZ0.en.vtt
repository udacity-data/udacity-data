Welcome to the end of the first lesson.

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:06.314
In this lesson, you saw an example of why data visualization,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.405
it's so important to the data analysis process.

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:12.089
You also learned about the primary libraries that will

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.594
be introduced in later lessons - Pandas,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.010
Seaborn, and Matplotlib - and how they

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.675
compliment each other in the visualization process.

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:21.050
In the next lesson,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.510
you will learn more about the design aspects of your visualizations.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.090
Further lessons will see you building visualizations for

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.439
both exploratory and explanatory analyses. See you in the next lesson.
