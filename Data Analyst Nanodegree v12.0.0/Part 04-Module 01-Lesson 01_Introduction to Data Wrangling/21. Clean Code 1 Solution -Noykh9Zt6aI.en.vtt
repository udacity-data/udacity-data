00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.797
OK, so we fill in the old names with the non-descriptive and misspelled column headers,

00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:09.785
these ones here, and the new names with the full word variants.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:12.664
We actually have four column headers to change here.

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:14.979
So the old names,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.140
and now the new names.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.490
The definition we made comes in handy here.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.695
Actually, we want job requirements,

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.835
plural. So we'll put that up there, too.

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:28.475
And SHIFT+ENTER, and that should do it.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.820
We can test our code immediately after but

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.640
we'll hold off for now for instructional purposes.
