00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
To simply use the name of the file like this,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:09.775
which again is online-job- postings.csv, not armenian-online-job-postings.zip anymore.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.734
The CSV file needs to be in the same folder as our notebook,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.684
which again, it is.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.324
And we press shift and enter and there we go.

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:23.280
It's as simple as that. If we type in DF and process the cell below,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.240
we'll see our CSV file shown as a Pandas DataFrame.
