00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.019
What if we tried to do that ASAP analysis and visualization on the original data set?

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.974
Do you recall what that data set looked like?

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:12.404
Since we made a copy of the original data set way back here,

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:14.969
we can easily access the original one,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.775
simply df rather than df_clean,

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:20.279
and perform the same analysis and visualization

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.900
we did down here on the original data set.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.779
Let's do that. And we want to change all of these df_cleans just to df.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.000
And the results are drastically different.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.704
The proportion of urgent job postings is below 50% here,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:42.129
a full 20% lower than our more accurate value post wrangling.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.185
This viz makes it abundantly clear.

00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:48.579
The before, 71% massive amount of blue.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.589
The after, 49% and less than half ASAP.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.000
The power of data wrangling is obvious here.
