Downloading files programatically is a bit out of the scope of this walkthrough.

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.990
Also some webites, including Kaggle,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.496
don't make it easy for us.

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:11.524
So make sure to stay tuned for lesson two of the course,

00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:13.764
where we'll cover the details of how to do this.

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:15.565
It feels pretty awesome.

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:18.004
Right now, we'll just click download.

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.070
For this to work, you need to be logged into your Kaggle account.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.350
So create one and log in, if you haven't already.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.050
Your browser should start downloading a.zip file,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.880
which is a format useful for reducing or compressing file sizes.

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:34.070
This file will probably go to your downloads folder.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.380
Let's make this a quick quiz.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.350
What is the full name of the file we just downloaded?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.539
We'll need this
