00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.000
Next, we need to unzip the file,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.160
then open the extracted files so that we can see and work with the data inside.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.310
We'll do both programmatically and therefore reproducibly,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.660
and we'll do both in our Jupyter Notebook.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.990
So first things first,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.574
we need to open up a Jupyter Notebook.

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:17.939
We can do that by typing Jupyter Notebook in

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
our terminal on Mac or Linux or command prompt on PC.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.475
Before we do that though,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.690
a notebook server will start in whatever directory we run this command in,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.595
which means any notebook files will be saved in that directory.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.984
And external files like our downloaded data set,

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:35.185
are most easily imported when in this directory.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.090
So I'm going to navigate to the folder I want to work in which is called

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.170
data wrangling which is within a folder in my documents called Udacity.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.490
So from my home directory,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.910
all changed directories or cd to documents,

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:54.199
then cd to Udacity and finally change directories to data wrangling.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.225
And now we can enter our Jupyter Notebook command.

00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:59.885
Okay. So here we can see our Jupyter Notebook dashboard

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:01.354
which shows a list of the notebooks,

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:05.649
files and sub-directories in the directory where the notebook server was started.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.650
Here we can create new notebooks by clicking New in Python

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.510
3 or you can use

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.550
the wrangling template notebook that's available for download which I put in this folder,

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.004
which you can see here.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.159
Side note: IPYNB stands for I Python Notebook,

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.060
which is the old name for Jupyter Notebooks.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.570
And I'll click that. And there we go.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.149
We've opened up a Jupyter Notebook.
