00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.459
Okay, so we'll structure our four loop by looping through every phrase in the list of

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:08.925
phrases similar to ASAP, aka ASAP list.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.179
Then use the Panda's function.replace to replace all of the instances of

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.370
that phrase that we're currently on in the iteration of the loop with ASAP.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.705
And let's double check our documentation here.

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:23.674
Okay, so replace the values given in to_replace with value.

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.280
Okay, so to_replace is the value that we want to replace which is the first parameter of

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.125
the function which is phrase or the current phrase that we're on in this loop,

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.075
which is one of these entries here.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:40.465
In the value we want to replace all of those with is ASAP, and again inplace=True.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:42.408
And if we click shift enter,

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.015
that should be it.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:46.869
We can test immediately after,

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.320
but we'll hold for instructional purposes.
