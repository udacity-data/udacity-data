00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.424
So before we can unzip the zip file,

00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.134
which we'll do in the cell here,

00:00:04.134 --> 00:00:08.134
we'll move our downloaded zip file to our projects working directory,

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:11.304
which you can see here in our Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:12.939
We don't need to do this,

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.234
but it's good to have all of our files in the same place,

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:17.704
and it makes unzipping slightly easier.

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:22.129
So we can do that by opening up a new terminal window or new command prompt,

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.852
and using our move command.

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.395
For Mac or Linux, that's MV,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:31.003
and the analogous command for Windows is move, M-O-V-E.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.859
The structure of the command is the same.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.969
First, we type in, move,

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.199
then the current file path of our zip file,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.520
which for me is Downloads/armenian-online-job-postings.zip.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.780
We can take advantage of the autocomplete feature here by typing in AR,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.245
then clicking tab, and that will save us some typing time.

00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:56.265
Then we type in the destination folder,

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:00.969
which for me is Documents/udacity/data-wrangling.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.742
And again, taking advantage of autocomplete, click enter,

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:09.070
and the file should show up in our Jupyter Notebook dashboard now.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.209
And great, there.
