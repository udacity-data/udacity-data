00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
So how do we start cleaning?

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:06.039
When done manually, like in spreadsheet programs or text editors, we just clean.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.035
But manual cleaning is inefficient, error-prone and demoralizing.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:13.214
Never clean manually, unless the issues are one-off occurrences,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:14.714
like changing column headers.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.370
Programmatic data cleaning is usually best and it's

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.160
the best thought as its own process with three steps,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.125
defining, coding and testing.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.009
So first we'll define a data cleaning plan in writing,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.245
where we turn our assessments into defined cleaning tasks.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:31.980
This plan will also serve as an instruction list so others

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.810
or us in the future can look at our work and reproduce it.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.730
Second, we'll translate these definitions to code and run that code.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.549
And finally we'll test our data set,

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:45.289
often using code, to make sure our cleaning operations worked.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.024
Let's get back to our walk-through again.

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:50.979
In the following exercises, you're going to write code to clean your data.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.279
This is where the magic happens.
