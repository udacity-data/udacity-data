00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
So no. This data set isn't tidy.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.299
For tidy data, we need each variable to be a column,

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.202
each observation to be a row,

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:12.459
and each type of observational unit to be a table.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.070
So first, we have duplicate representation of data.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.765
One in this column here, the date column,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.105
January 5th 2004 for example, month, day,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.379
year that also again at the end

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.945
of the data set here with Year and Month having their own columns.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:32.105
Here is the duplicate representation of date data.

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.669
So that means we have two representations of year and month data.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.875
For tidy, we need one day,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.659
one month and one year.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.464
So if we have to make updates to the data we only have to do it in one place.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:47.475
I would also argue that there are two types of observational units in this dataset;

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.420
job posting data and then company data.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.155
To make this tidy, we would have to separate these into two tables: One,

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:59.965
the job posting data having everything in this dataset except for this AboutC column.

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:03.330
And then a second, the Company table with

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.090
only desk company column and this AboutC column or About Company column.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
For this walk through though we are going to skip documenting

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.635
this lack of tidiness and not fix it in the clean step.

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:17.040
I want to keep this lesson short.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
For one it also because non-tidy data is okay sometimes.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.650
Jeff Leek explains this well in his blog post on non-tidy data.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.484
Pause the video and take a moment to read this paragraph.

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:32.969
Take my word that forth this walkthrough and the analyses and visualizations that you are

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.579
going to create are data in a non tidy format works
