00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
If we scroll through our DataFrame a bit more,

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:06.309
we'll notice that Pandas automatically collapses some columns

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:10.390
and rows of larger DataSets like this one, which you can see here.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.810
Between row 29 and row 18,971,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.824
all of the rows are collapsed using these ellipses here.

00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:20.919
And the same thing is true if we scroll right here and check out all of our columns.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.330
Every column between duration and salary was again collapsed using these ellipses.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.679
Pandas does this because viewing large DataSets takes up too much space.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.054
And scrolling that much can cause headaches.

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:35.085
This is also the downside I mentioned previously,

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.512
about visual assessment being difficult in Pandas.

00:00:37.512 --> 00:00:41.699
Uncollapsing these columns and rows is finicky,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.590
and scrolling up and down and side to side in Jupyter Notebook cells isn't great.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.140
Instead, I like to use Pandas's Info function to get more information about our DataSet.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.734
This is a form of programmatic assessment.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.034
This function is extremely simple.

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:58.454
We type the name of our DataFrame,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:01.644
which is df, then .Info.

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.570
And again, I'll use SHIFT and TAB here,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.081
to explore the Signature and Docstring of the function.

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:11.040
Okay. Signature, DF dot info and Docstring.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.005
Concise summary of a DataFrame.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.949
Docstring tells us what the function does.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.030
Concise summary of a DataFrame.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.969
Okay. So we'll process this cell, SHIFT and ENTER.

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.177
And here's that Concise Summary.

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:26.954
We've got 19,001 entries and 24 columns.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:30.385
Then, a bunch of information about each of those columns below,

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:33.000
including the types of values in those columns

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.632
and the total memory usage of the DataFrame.

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:38.844
Okay. So let's look through these columns a bit.

00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:41.025
What is ApplicationP?

00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:42.792
What's AboutC?

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:48.045
One of the fundamentals of quality data is having descriptive variable and value names.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:54.245
Even RequiredQual, which means required qualifications, isn't that descriptive.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:57.980
Even JobRequirment, which has a small typo in it,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.646
that's descriptive enough, but you might as well fix it if we can.

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:04.659
Let's make a note to clarify all of these when cleaning.
