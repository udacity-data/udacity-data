00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay, so missing records are a common issue that

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.429
you'll deal with a ton in your data wrangling career.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:11.455
Pandas represents them as NaNs or NaN which means not a number.

00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:15.175
These are important to be aware of as they can cause problems when coding.

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:16.964
Okay then, as soon as possible,

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:20.670
immediately, and ASAP for a start date.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.335
These all mean the same thing.

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.650
Start this job now.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.750
But searching for that single notion in that column

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.079
isn't easy because there are multiple ways of referring to the same thing.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.750
ASAP, immediately, as soon as possible.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.405
Ideally, there would only be one way.

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:39.600
Let's make a note to fix these two quality issues that we

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.100
identified and we'll do that by inserting a new cell below here,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.609
a markdown cell, and we'll write missing values,

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.914
NaN and StartDate inconsistencies.

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:56.435
Assessing your data is often this easy.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:01:00.200
You look through it, notice glaring errors and make notes of them.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.685
In this snapshot of the data set,

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:04.344
everything else seems okay.

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:10.049
These funky symbols here are okay since that is the original job posting with raw HTML.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980
These backslashes followed by letters are called

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.520
Escape Constructs and they help structure text on webpages,

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.155
like newlines and special characters.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:22.070
We want to preserve the structure of the original posting so we

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.149
won't make note of these as issues to fix in the clean step.
