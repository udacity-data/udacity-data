00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
For this walkthrough, we're going to download a file from the internet and import it

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.800
into a Jupyter Notebook which is one of many ways of gathering data.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.820
When downloading files from the Internet,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.464
downloading could be as simple as going to the page where the data set is hosted,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.324
like this Kaggle page for example,

00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:18.730
and clicking the download button.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.414
But best practice is actually to download files programmatically, i.e.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:28.079
with code, for two reasons, scalability and reproducibility.
