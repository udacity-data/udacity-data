00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.349
Okay, so we loop through the phrases in asap_list. Again, up here.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.714
And we want to assert that each phrase is not

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:12.280
in the start date column of our supposedly clean data frame.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:19.324
So assert phrase not in df_clean.StartDate and then there's some Pandas trickery here.

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:21.864
We actually need to type in. values here.

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:24.474
If not, as I'll show you below,

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:30.830
Pandas check to see if each phrase is in the index column of df_clean.StartDate.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.289
We want the values,

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.600
and if we process the cell and we have no assertion errors, we're good.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.414
Our cleaning code worked. And great.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.460
So this is what would happen if there was a phrase left.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.929
There should be plenty of entries with ASAP.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.524
6,856, in fact.

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:53.859
So if we assert that ASAP is not in df_clean.StartDate.values,

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.000
Python should yell at us and it does. AssertionError.
