00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
Let's visually inspect our jobs data first.

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.099
To do this, we'll type in "df" in this cell here below the "Assess" heading,

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.789
and process it using Shift+Enter,

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.154
and we'll just scroll through our data frame.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:17.984
Okay, so we've got the first row here as column headers: "job post",

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.964
"date", "title", "company", etc.

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:23.759
and we've got a bunch of rows here.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.205
Scroll to the bottom,

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:30.904
and we've got 19,001 rows and 24 columns.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.975
Let's scroll up a bit here.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:37.260
Something caught my eye. Okay. So in this snapshot of the data frame,

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.149
check the boxes that, to you,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.000
feel like data quality or tidiness issues that we'll need to fix.
