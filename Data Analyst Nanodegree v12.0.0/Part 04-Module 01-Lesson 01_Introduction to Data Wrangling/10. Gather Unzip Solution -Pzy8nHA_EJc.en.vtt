00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.919
So we modified the file and mode parameters as mentioned in the zipfile documentation.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.734
File and mode.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:14.029
So, our file is called,

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.669
online-job-postings.zip, and the mode we want is read,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.455
r, not w, write.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:30.432
Then we can process the cell using shift and enter. What happened here?

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:35.670
We have zipfile not defined.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.435
Okay. That's what we have to do.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.375
With zipfile.zipfile.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.204
And that should do it.

00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:53.070
Let's check our folder in our terminal to see if our file was extracted from the zipfile.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.630
And we'll type ls.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.170
And it looks like it is. Data job posts.csv.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.195
We actually check it here too.

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:08.229
And there it is as well.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.945
Great job.

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.649
We now have ourselves a csv file.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.045
We'll cover this file type in the next video.

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:17.504
Plus the actual exciting part of gathering,

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:22.000
which is opening, or importing the data set in our programming environment.
