00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
Alright. So we've successfully downloaded and imported our dataset.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.160
Now we need to assess our data to determine what's clean and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.875
potentially what else to gather if we're missing some data.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:13.460
We're not exploring our dataset.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.440
We just want to make sure our data is in a form that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.975
makes our analysis easier later on. More on this in a bit.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:21.960
Okay. So what are we assessing?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.830
What is dirty data?

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.799
What is messy data?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.658
We're looking for two main things: Our data's quality and it's tidiness.

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:31.545
Low quality data is dirty.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.660
Untidy data is messy.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.639
We don't have to look for these in order, but you can.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.960
Let's formerly define quality and tininess next.
