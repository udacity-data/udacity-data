00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.419
Congratulations. You've reached the end of the first lesson of our Data Wrangling course.

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.560
You experience the Data Wrangling process first hand and exercise

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.564
your coding skills to gather assess and clean a real data set from Kaggle.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.349
You've also caught a glimpse into the remainder of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.509
the course but you'll mastered gathering,

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.714
assessing, and cleaning data in the three lessons ahead.

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:22.350
You've also seen how in-demand data skills are in today's society.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.450
And, Data Wrangling skills make up

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.079
a huge chunk of that demand because so much of the world's data isn't clean.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.594
So keep up the great work.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:31.769
You're well on your way to becoming a data pro.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.969
And stay tuned.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.619
I can't wait for you to see the data sets that

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.369
you'll be wrangling in the rest of the course.
