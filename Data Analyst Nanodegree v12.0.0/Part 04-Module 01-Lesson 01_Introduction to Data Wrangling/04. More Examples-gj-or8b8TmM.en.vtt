00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
So, my experience was pretty low stakes.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:08.140
Wrangling data for a blog post that would maybe get a few hundred views.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.100
But data wrangling, or more appropriately,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.740
the consequences from a lack of data wrangling,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.210
can be serious business.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.673
For sure.

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:21.539
Imagine you're a financial analyst creating models to make million dollar trades for you.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
Your data better be clean or you could go broke.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.695
Or imagine you're a scientist for a drug company that's about to start human trials for

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.829
a life-saving new drug and you need to determine

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.759
the right dosage for humans based on your lab and animal tests.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:37.710
Your data needs to be clean or your drug

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.575
might not work and you could seriously hurt people.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.255
So while you're going to get some analysis and visualization in this course.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.440
It's really about getting your data ready so that

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.059
anything you create is built on a solid foundation.
