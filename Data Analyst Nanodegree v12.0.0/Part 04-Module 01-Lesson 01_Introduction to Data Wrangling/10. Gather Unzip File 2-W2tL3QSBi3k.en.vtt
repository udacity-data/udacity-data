00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.529
Now we can unzip the file.

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:05.384
We'll do that using Python zip file library.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.740
Using code to make our wrangling work as reproduceable as possible,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.769
as opposed to using an external program or clicking and unzipping the file.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.924
So we import the zip file library in this cell,

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:19.789
then process that cell using shift and enter.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.019
At this point, we should open up

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.089
the zip file library documentation to

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.875
figure out how to read the contents of the zip file.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.035
You can briefly scan through it here, but it's kind of dense.

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.620
So I like to use our browsers find

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.289
feature which is command+F or control+F depending on your operating system.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.774
Let's look for read.

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.699
We want to read the contents of our zip file.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.555
Okay. Class zipfile.ZipFile, the class for reading and writing zip files.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:50.615
Then it directs us down here, ZipFile Objects.

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.859
If you're not an expert in Python classes, don't worry.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.582
This just means we can type zipfile.ZipFile with some parameters,

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:01.234
together called the constructor,

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:03.994
to create something called an object

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:08.204
that has special coding abilities also known as methods.

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:10.210
Okay. If you read through here a little,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.010
notice that it says the mode parameter should be 'r' to read an existing file.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.800
That's what we want to do.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.554
If we scroll even further we see,

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:28.116
"ZipFile is also a context manager and therefore supports the with statement."

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:31.590
Context managers are very popular for reading files.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.219
The act of opening a file,

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.200
which we need to do in reading and writing files,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.465
consumes a resource on your computer.

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:39.085
And if we forget to close the file,

00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:41.984
we can get in trouble with error messages or crashes.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:45.010
Context managers make sure all files we open are closed,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.225
and all resources we use are properly cleaned up.

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:52.799
Okay. So we can actually just copy and paste this code here into our Jupyter Notebook,

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.155
but you shouldn't copy and paste it, now and in the future.

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.719
Wherever possible, it's best to type out the code.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.745
It will help you learn, but for the sake of time,

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:03.340
I'll take a shortcut here and copy and paste.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.793
We actually need one more thing here,

00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:07.730
zipfile.ZipFile to make this code work.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.217
Okay, so we don't want to write to a zip file though

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:13.080
with this 'w' and this write method here.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.225
We want to extract or read the files within our zip file.

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:21.634
A quick Google search directed me to this method within the zip file documentation.

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:25.774
Extractall, which doesn't need any parameters as you can see here,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:29.110
default none, default none, default none.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.155
In contrast to the Write method which I'll delete right now.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:39.027
Okay, so we'll change our code to myzip.extractall with no parameters.

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:44.524
And all that's left to do now is change these two parameters, file and mode.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:49.219
File is the name of the zip file and mode is what we want to do with the file,

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.199
like read or write to it.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.000
The zip file we want to open should be in

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.905
the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook at this point.

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:57.640
Go ahead and change those parameters.
