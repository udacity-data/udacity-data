00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.014
&gt;&gt; Now, how do we actually assess quality and tidiness?

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.664
There are two styles of assessing your data, visual and programmatic.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:11.969
Assessing the data visually means having a human look at over with their eyes.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.275
This can be done in Pandas,

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:14.535
but for small files,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.800
it's usually easier to do this in a spreadsheet application like Excel or Google sheets.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.765
Some data sets are so large though

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:25.105
that most spreadsheet apps will crash just trying to open them.

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:27.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this happened to me with the job data set.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.675
Handling large files is one of many areas where Pandas

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.149
actually excels, and Excel doesn't.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.350
&gt;&gt; Pretty funny.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.005
&gt;&gt; Thanks. But yeah,

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.915
Pandas isn't great for browsing through large data sets either.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.659
Pandas automatically collapses rows and columns,

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.769
plus scrolling isn't super fun in Jupyter Notebook cells.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.970
&gt;&gt; No, it's not.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.865
So for larger data sets,

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.960
programmatic assessment is better.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.475
Assessing the data programmatically means using

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:56.640
a computer program to help detect problems in the data.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.429
&gt;&gt; This is where Pandas excels.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.005
One simple example is Pandas' info function

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:04.170
which gives us the basic structure and content of our data frame.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.079
&gt;&gt; So we've got visual and programmatic assessment,

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.239
searching for quality and tidiness.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:11.949
This is where you get to play data detective.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.424
&gt;&gt; Let's get back to our walkthrough.

00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:14.724
In the following exercises,

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:17.204
you'll use visual and programmatic assessments to spot

00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:22.000
data quality issues plus detect the presence of a tidy or non-tidy data set.
