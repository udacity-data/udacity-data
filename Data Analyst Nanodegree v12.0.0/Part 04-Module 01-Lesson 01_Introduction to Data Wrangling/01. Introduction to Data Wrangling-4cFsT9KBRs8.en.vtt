00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Hi and welcome. My name's David.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.740
And I'm Mat. In this course,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.024
we'll be learning all about data wrangling.

00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:09.629
Data wrangling is the process of gathering your data,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.400
assessing its quality and structure,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.130
and cleaning it before you do things like analysis,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.725
visualization, or build predictive models using machine learning.

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.445
Sometimes, it's as simple as downloading a file,

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:21.585
spotting a few typos,

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:23.115
and fixing those typos.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.559
But other times, your data really isn't clean.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.674
That is, you'll have missing records,

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:29.894
duplicates, and inaccurate data.

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:33.240
Sometimes, the data itself is fine but structurally,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.810
it's difficult to work with.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.530
Taking care of all this is necessary or else,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.715
you risk making mistakes,

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:40.890
missing insights and wasting time.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.200
Wrangling is a core skill that you'll use to varying degrees on

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.932
every data set that you work with because so much of the world's data isn't clean.

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:52.215
Fortunately, when done with code,

00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:55.560
wrangling is fast and almost magical.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.015
And by the end of this course,

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.250
data wrangling will become instinctual.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000
So, are you ready to wrangle? Let's get to it.
