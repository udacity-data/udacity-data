00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
Now we've gathered the data and made a few assessments.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.639
The few is important. We don't need to

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.050
identify every issue right from the start. We can iterate.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.355
So now we can start cleaning.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.634
Cleaning means acting on the assessments we made to improve quality and tidiness.

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:19.804
Improving quality doesn't mean changing the data to make it say something different.

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:21.419
That would be data fraud.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.575
Instead, we're talking about things like correcting it when it's

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:28.359
inaccurate or removing data when it's wrong or irrelevant.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.199
Yeah, or replacing, like filling in missing values;

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.600
or merging, like combining gather datasets that were split up.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.440
All of this stuff can be done manually,

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.049
but it's most efficiently done using code that minimizes repetition.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.330
Improving tidiness means transforming the dataset so that each variable is a column,

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:45.900
each observation is a row,

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.945
and each type of observational unit is a table.

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:51.814
There are special functions of Pandas that help us do that.

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:54.189
We'll dive deeper into those in Lesson Four of the course.
