00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Gathering data is always the first step in data wrangling.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.724
The idea is before gathering,

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:08.369
we have no data and after it, we do.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.910
This is sometimes called acquiring your data, or collecting it.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.390
Gathering captures the spirit of the task best, in my opinion.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.789
A bit of a scurrying is often required plus some unexpectedness.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.219
Yeah for sure. As you saw my personal example I had to download

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.942
three datasets and scrape data off of a web page to fill in missing values.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.500
It was a lot of scurrying around.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.475
And depending on where you find your data and what format it's in,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.429
the steps of the gathering process can vary.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:36.914
If the data is in a file,

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:39.329
gathering often means downloading the file and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.725
importing it into your programming environment like a Jupyter Notebook.

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:43.940
Yes, exactly.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.329
This is what we'll do on our walk through.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.019
Other methods of gathering are things like collecting

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.465
data from files and databases which is what you'll usually do in the workplace.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:57.540
Or you can scrape data off a website or get it from an API,

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.494
which stands for application programming interface.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:06.009
APIs let us programmatically access data from applications like Twitter and Facebook.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.685
There are even more on top of that.

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.734
But let's stay focused and get to our walk through.

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.655
Gathering data is fun to me because it can vary so

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:17.290
widely but we'll get to the fancier methods in Lesson 2 of the course, so stay tuned.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.440
For now we're going to download a file from a website

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.000
and import it into our programming environment.
