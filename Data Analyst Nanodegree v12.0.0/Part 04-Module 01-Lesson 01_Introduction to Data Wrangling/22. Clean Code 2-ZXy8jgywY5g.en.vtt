00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
OK, so now let's attack the fun issue.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.230
You're really going to feel like magicians after this.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.160
We will need to identify all of the records in

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.535
the start date column that have as soon as possible,

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.025
immediately and such somehow,

00:00:15.025 --> 00:00:19.329
then we need to replace the text and all of those cells with ASAP.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.829
What are the other versions of this though?

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.279
Let's take a look at the most common start dates using

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.975
Pandas' value counts function on the start dates column in DF clean data frame.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:33.185
Value counts as one of the programmatic assessments that we covered previously.

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:38.530
OK, so immediately, as soon as possible, immediate, immediate employment,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.307
as soon as possible with a period,

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:46.854
immediate job opportunity, these all seem similar in spirit to as soon as possible to me.

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.074
And there are actually a ton more,

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:51.310
which is conveyed through this ellipsis here.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.530
You can actually expand these results here

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.719
and check for all of the similar phrases yourself.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.945
But I did some legwork preparing for this class,

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:01.539
and found it listed every value similar in

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.375
spirit for your convenience, which I'll paste here.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.275
You're going to have to do this dirty work

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.725
yourself when you go out wrangling on your own.

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:14.824
So keep this in mind. OK. So let's convert all of these to ASAP.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.870
We're going to have to test each entry in

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.079
the start date column for a match with every item in this list.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.375
Then replace the ones that do match with ASAP.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:27.625
Note that the items in this list need to be strings,

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:31.135
because the datatype of the start date column is string,

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.378
also known as object in Pandas.

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:36.769
T type or O object.

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:40.414
OK, so let's hop on Google again and see how Pandas can help us out here.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:43.540
OK, so Pandas replace values in series.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.350
A series is also known as a column in a Pandas data frame.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.449
And we want to replace values in the start date column or start date series.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.299
So this first search result here is actually what you're going to use,

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.474
but there are lots of ways of accomplishing this task in Pandas.

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.254
But this is the most straightforward.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.759
So Panda's dot series dot replace.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.140
OK, so the data replace function operates on a Pandas series and it replaces values

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.079
given in to replace where the first parameter with value or the second parameter.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.950
One more thing to keep in mind is this in-place parameter here.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.905
The default for in-place is false.

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.840
We're actually going to convert this to true.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.270
So we can just minimize our code.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.215
You'll see how it works in a second.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:28.884
OK, let's get this in our Jupyter Notebook.

00:02:28.884 --> 00:02:30.549
and df_clean.StartDate is

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.625
our series and we want to use dot replace on this series.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.870
In-place true means that we can just write this line of code

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.819
here and execute it and the changes it makes will be reflected in D.F clean.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.659
If there was no inplace true here,

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.210
we would have to reassign the results of this function to our start date column.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.585
OK so because there are so many phrases similar to ASAP,

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:54.655
we are going to need to use a for loop to minimize code repetition,

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:58.300
with the body of the for loop being this dot replace function.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.130
The rest of this code is your task in the upcoming quiz.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.949
Write a for loop and fill out the parameters in this line of code here to replace

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.329
every phrase similar in spirit to ASAP with ASAP.
