00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.924
The file we extracted is a CSV file,

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.589
online job postings dot csv.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.869
But I'm going to show you a different one here for simplicity.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.674
CSV stands for comma separated values,

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.120
and is a common file format to representing tabular data.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.169
A CSV file is actually a text file which you can see on the left here.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.035
It can be created and edited using any text editor,

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:24.972
again, which you can see on the left.

00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:27.509
More frequently, however, a CSV file is

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.975
created by exporting data from a spreadsheet or database.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:35.200
On the right here, we have the CSV file opened in a spreadsheet application.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.984
I'm using Google sheets.

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:38.542
Let's go back to the left side though,

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:42.740
the text editor so we can see how the internals of the CSV file works.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.968
See, have data here has all of these comma separators,

00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:48.170
comma here, comma here.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.885
There are two commas in each row.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:52.394
These are also known as delimiters.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:55.185
Each line of data represents a row.

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:57.109
This is the first row, which you can see here.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.850
This is the second row, mountain beaver, second row.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.520
Third row, fourth row, and so on.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.665
While all of the values before the first comma in each line represent the first column,

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.765
the first column being animal,

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:13.269
for example, which you can see here.

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:15.435
Then, everything after the first comma and before

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:18.375
the second one represents the second column.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:22.084
And finally, everything after the second comma is the third column.

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:24.649
There are tons of other file formats like JSON,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.550
txt, and html among others.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.000
We'll cover those and more in the next lesson in the course.
