00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.900
We've gathered, assessed and just cleaned our data. Are we done?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.730
No. After cleaning, we always

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.345
reassess and then iterate on any of the steps if we need to.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.565
If we're happy with the quality and tightness of our data,

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.484
we can end our wrangling process and move on to storing our clean data,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:23.839
or analyzing, visualizing, or modeling it.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.629
Sometimes we realize we need to gather more data.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:29.549
Sometimes we miss assessments.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.760
It's hard to catch everything on the first go,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.760
and it's also very common to find

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:37.344
new issues as you're fixing the ones you've already identified.

00:00:37.344 --> 00:00:41.335
Sometimes our cleaning operations don't work as we intended.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:43.774
Once we go through each step once,

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:46.864
we can revisit any step in the process any time.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:52.995
Even after we've finished wrangling and moved on to analysis, visualization, or modeling.

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:55.789
So don't worry if wrangling seems daunting.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.000
Feel free to start small and cycle through the process a few times.
