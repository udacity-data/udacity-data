00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
And it's your turn now. I'm going to

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.424
provide you with some programmatic assessments to execute.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:07.049
And it's your job to determine which part of the results of

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.314
these assessments reveal data quality issues.

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:18.780
So the first one, series.value_counts on the patient's surname and address.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.105
So I think this is a bit curious. Let's expand on that.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:28.362
.duplicated reveals the duplicates in the address column.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.309
So I definitely see something here. I hope you do, too.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.509
If you don't that's okay, you'll see shortly.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:35.265
And here's another programmatic assessment.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:39.689
sort_values on the weight column to the patients table.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:44.019
And one more, using the.isnull method on

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.915
the Auralin and Novadra columns in conjunction with sum.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.439
Okay, so please try to detect the data quality issues

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.289
in the following snapshots in the following quizzes.
