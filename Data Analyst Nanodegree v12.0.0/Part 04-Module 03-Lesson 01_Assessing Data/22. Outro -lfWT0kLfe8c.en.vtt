00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.450
Congratulations, you've completed our lesson on assessing data,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.884
the second step of the data wrangling process.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:13.859
You visually and programmatically assessed a data set full of data quality and

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.744
tidiness issues and you caught and categorized every issue,

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.070
despite never having seen the data.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.195
Like a true detective thrown onto the case. That takes talent.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.265
Every dirty messy data set,

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.214
and there are lots of them that exist in the world,

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:31.859
is dirty and messy in its own unique way and the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.750
assessment strategies that you acquired in this lesson are transferable to all of them.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.659
This is a big deal. Now it's time to put these assessments into action.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.824
In the next lesson you're going to clean

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:46.275
the same dataset and fix all of these issues using code.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:48.000
Here's where the magic happens.
