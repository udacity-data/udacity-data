00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:06.899
Reminder, data wrangling can be iterative.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.350
You just finished a round of assessments.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:10.955
You can move on to cleaning at this point,

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:15.065
or revisit gathering if you determine that you didn't gather enough data.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:17.039
You can even assess some more.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.405
Once you go through each step of the data wrangling process once,

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:22.315
you can revisit them at any time,

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:24.890
even after we've finished wrangling and have moved on

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.000
to analysis, visualization or modeling.
