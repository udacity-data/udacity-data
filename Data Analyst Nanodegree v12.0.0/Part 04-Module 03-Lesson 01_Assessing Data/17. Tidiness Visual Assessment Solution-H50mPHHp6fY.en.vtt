00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
These auralin and novodra columns violate the first rule of tidiness only,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.599
that each variable forms a column.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.751
There are three variables here: treatment, auralin or novodra,

00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:14.655
start dose, for example 41 units here,

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:15.989
and then end dose,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.030
for example 48 units here.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.970
So since there are three variables here there should be three columns

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.035
and there are currently two and both contain two variables.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:29.190
The auralin column contains the start and end dose for auralin patients and

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.109
the novodra column contains the start

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.109
and end dose for patients that were treated with novodra.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.734
If these two columns both contain two variables,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.280
start and end dose each,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.560
where is that missing third variable?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.335
We said there were three variables here, right?

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:43.770
Well, the third variable,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.565
treatment, is hidden in the column headers here.

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:50.834
This is actually one of the most common tidiness issues as per Hadley Wickham.

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:53.939
Column headers are values not variable names.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.924
So auralin and novodra are our values for the treatment variable.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:01.019
Whoever structured the data set like this didn't plan very

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.010
well and wasn't aware of the advantages of tidy data.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.710
The final product should look like this.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.559
Let's zoom in here a bit.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.079
So, for the first patient, Veronika Jindrova, she was treated with auralin,

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.390
the auralin insulin, with the starting dose of 41 units and an ending dose of 48 units.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.515
Auralin, 41, 48.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:22.245
Then for Elliot Richardson he was treated with novodra.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:23.820
Starting dose of 40 units,

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.289
ending dose of 45 units and novodra, 40, 45.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.550
Three separate variables in three separate columns.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.739
Treatment, start dose, end dose.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.629
You'll learn how to convert the two columns on

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.804
the left to the three columns on the right,

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:43.210
programmatically using the melt function and split method in Pandas next lesson.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.509
The melt function specifically is really

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.550
handy but it can be confusing especially if you never seen it before.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.189
Next lesson you'll conquer that.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.299
So let's document this second tidiness issue.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.000
And there we go. Here's our observation.
