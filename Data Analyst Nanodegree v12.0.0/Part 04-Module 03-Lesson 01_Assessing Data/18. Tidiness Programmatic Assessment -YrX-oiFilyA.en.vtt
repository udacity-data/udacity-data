00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Let's use programmatic assessment now to detect and

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.699
document the final tidiness issue in this dataset.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.094
Programmatic assessment can be handy for the third tidiness requirement,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:14.160
which is that each type of observational unit forms a table.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.050
This requirement focuses on the columns of

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.914
the dataset across all tables, if there are multiple.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.359
Which makes programmatic assessment especially useful if

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.064
the dataset you're assessing has lots of columns and/or lots of tables.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.440
This makes visual assessment harder because resizing windows,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.015
switching between spreadsheet tabs,

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.379
scrolling through a Pandas data frame,

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.924
etc., is just kind of annoying.

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:35.334
With programmatic assessments like the dot_info method,

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.640
we can get a quick glance at all of our column names across all tables,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.070
and also the data types within them.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
So we'll reuse our dot_info cells here for patients,

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.149
treatments and adverse reactions.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.500
So take a look through these column headers and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.590
really think about which headers should belong in what table.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.489
How many tables do we need to make this clinical trial dataset as a whole?
