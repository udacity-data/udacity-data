00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.935
Now that you know how to gather data,

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.035
you're going to master assessing it.

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:11.685
Assessing your data is the second step in the data wrangling process.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:14.410
When assessing, you're like a detective at work.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.765
Inspecting your data set for two things: Data quality issues and lack of tidiness.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:24.070
Data that has quality issues has issues with content like missing,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.469
duplicate or incorrect data.

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.479
This is called dirty data.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.685
An untidy or messy data has specific structural issues.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.070
These structural issues slow you down when cleaning and analyzing,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.924
visualizing or modeling your data later.

00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:41.919
You can search for these issues in two ways: Visually,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.000
with a simple scroll and programmatically using code.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.469
And when you detect an issue,

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.394
you document it to make cleaning easier.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:51.979
In this lesson, you will assess a pre-gathered data

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:55.174
set that's full of issues and you're going to find all of them.

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:59.664
Some visually and others using the functions in Python's Pandas library.

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:02.695
At the end of the lesson, we'll flash forward to analysis

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.150
and visualization where you'll see how your assessments were vital.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.710
You're going to leave this lesson with an eagle eye for

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:12.000
unclean data and there's a lot of it in the world.
