00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
This should be in two tables, patients and treatments.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.014
Patients would be exactly the same in terms of these columns here.

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:08.544
All 14 would remain.

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:12.960
Then I'd argue that the adverse reaction column of the adverse reactions table,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.520
the very last one down here,

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.829
I'd argue that this belongs in the treatments table.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.454
If we want to look at treatment data,

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.859
the adverse reaction for that treatment is naturally connected.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.314
This is the same type of observational unit.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:27.780
So because the other two columns in this adverse reactions table,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.950
given name and surname,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.655
are actually duplicated in the treatments and also the patients table.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.865
We'll actually also want to remove these duplicate column names.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:39.025
Duplicate column names can be found more generally in Pandas,

00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:42.269
using these following code.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.890
This first line creates a list of all of

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.765
the column names across the whole data set, all three tables worth.

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:56.234
Puts it into a series.

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:58.189
Then we use the dot_duplicated method on

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:01.739
that series and we see that given name and surname are duplicated.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.410
This list, then the data frame,

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.209
returns a list of all of the columns in the data frame.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.354
So with these duplicate given name and surname columns removed,

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.920
as well as the other two tidiness issues fixed,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.420
our final tidy data set should look like this.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.750
Two tables, patients, treatments,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.155
with the only shared column between the two being patient ID.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:25.460
It's best practice to have the ID as one primary identifier across tables,

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.544
because ID won't change. Name could change.

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:31.939
For example, if someone legally changes their name via marriage or something.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.000
So having given name and surname in one table only,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.454
means you only have to update these columns in one table.

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:41.179
Consolidating these three tables as they currently stand,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.115
patients, treatments, adverse reactions,

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:44.839
into the two displayed here,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.240
requires joining, which is something you'll do in lesson four of this course.
