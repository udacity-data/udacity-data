00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.985
The increasing prevalence of diabetes in the 21st century is a problem, an epidemic even.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.240
Pre 1920s, diabetes was a feared disease,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.400
that most certainly led to death.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.765
Doctors knew what it was,

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:15.735
uncontrollable and often elevated blood sugar levels,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.429
but not how to treat it, let alone cure it.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.495
This meant patients dealt with symptoms like unusual thirst,

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:23.785
frequent urination, extreme fatigue,

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:26.445
and also more serious complications like stroke,

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.214
blindness, loss of limbs,

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.410
kidney failure, and even heart attack.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.009
Luckily, in the 1920s,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.710
a secretion in the pancreas that lowered blood sugar levels,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.660
soon to be called insulin,

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.034
was discovered by soon to be Nobel Prize winner Frederick Banting.

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:42.809
This is how insulin works.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.150
Most of the food we eat is turned to glucose,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.299
or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.789
The pancreas, an organ near the stomach,

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.710
makes a hormone called insulin,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.829
to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.015
When you have diabetes,

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.145
your body either doesn't make enough insulin

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.710
or can't use its own insulin as well as it should.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.215
And this causes sugars to build-up in the blood.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.689
With Banting discovery of insulin,

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.694
pharmaceutical companies began large-scale production of insulin almost immediately.

00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:12.474
Although it doesn't cure diabetes,

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:14.939
it's one of the biggest discoveries in medicine.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.709
When it came, it was like a miracle.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.059
People with severe diabetes,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.269
and only days left to live were saved,

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.579
but the default method of administration back then was a needle,

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.164
multiple times a day, and it still is now.

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.745
This is scary for some people and uncomfortable and inconvenient for the vast majority.

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:33.060
Insulin pumps are a more recent invention.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.950
These are insulin delivering devices that are

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.859
semi-permanently connected to a diabetics body.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.174
But wouldn't it be great if diabetics could take insulin orally,

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:43.829
carrying around a pocketable packet of pills,

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.439
rather than a kit of vials and needles or wearing a bulky somewhat uncomfortable device?

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.730
The future. Oral insulin.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.609
This is an active area of research,

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.200
and has been for a long time.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.299
Historically though there's been a big roadblock,

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.429
getting insulin through the stomachs thick lining.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.500
In these next two lessons,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.155
we've got our hands on the phase two clinical trial data

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:07.405
for a new innovative oral insulin called auralin.

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.199
Auralin researchers believe their proprietary capsule

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.689
will solve this stomach lining problem.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.316
Phase two trials test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug,

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:18.824
plus identify common short term side effects,

00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:21.054
also known as adverse reactions.

00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:23.460
These typically involve several hundred patients.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.469
In this trial, we have 350,

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:26.745
split into two groups.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:31.462
One hundred seventy five or half treated with the new oral insulin auralin,

00:02:31.462 --> 00:02:36.074
and the other 175 being treated with the popular injectable insulin called novodra.

00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.685
By comparing key metrics between these two drugs,

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:41.150
we can determine if auralin is effective.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.557
The most important metric,

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:46.729
HbA1c levels, and specifically, HbA1c change.

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.164
This sounds super technical,

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:49.361
and it kind of is,

00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:51.435
but don't let it intimidate you.

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:54.599
HbA1c is a property of the blood that measures how

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.424
well your blood sugar levels have been controlled over the past few months.

00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:00.405
With higher levels, being bad.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:02.849
If auralin, the new oral insulin,

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.060
can reduce HbA1c_levels at a similar standard as

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.125
the injectable insulin novodra from some standard pretrial baseline,

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:15.411
like say they both decrease HbA1c_levels from 7.9% to 7.4%,

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:17.235
that's a 0.5% drop.

00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:18.922
If we can get a 0.4 change,

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:21.314
we've got ourselves a major medical breakthrough,

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:24.689
in the dramatic quality of life improvement for diabetics all over the world.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.329
Before we can get to that point of recommendation though,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.219
we've got ourselves another problem.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.324
Healthcare data is notorious for its errors and disorganization,

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.884
and its clinical trial data is no exception.

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:36.629
For example, human errors during

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.704
the patient registration process means we can have duplicate data,

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.760
missing data and inaccurate data.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.899
And this common healthcare data issue is reflected in this clinical trial data.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.000
In this lesson, you're going to take the first step in fixing these issues.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.504
You're going to assess this data sets quality and tidiness,

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.590
and take note of all of these issues.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.229
In the next lesson,

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.000
you'll then clean all of these issues using Python and Pandas.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.544
The end goal, being able to create a trustworthy analysis.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.828
And hopefully, eventually recommend this new drug,

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.205
this new oral insulin,

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.350
to continue to large-scale production and

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.000
improve the lives of diabetics all over the world.
