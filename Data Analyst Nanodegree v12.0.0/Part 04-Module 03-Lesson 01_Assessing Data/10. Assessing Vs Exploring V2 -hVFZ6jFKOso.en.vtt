00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.935
There is a subtle difference between assessing your data and exploring your data.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.669
Assessing is part of the data wrangling process,

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.675
while exploring is part of Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.885
Data wrangling is about gathering the right pieces of data,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.015
assessing your data's quality and structure,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.490
then modifying your data to make it clean.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.594
But the assessments you make and convert to cleaning operations,

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:28.140
won't make your analysis,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.359
VIS, or model better though.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.259
The goal is just to make them work.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.984
EDA is about exploring your data to later augment it,

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.289
to maximize the potential of your analyses, visualizations and models.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.570
When exploring, simple visualizations are

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.155
often used to summarize your data's main characteristics.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:49.140
From there, you can do things like remove outliers and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.109
create new and more descriptive features from existing data,

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.820
also known as feature engineering.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.274
In practice, wrangling and EDA can occur together,

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:01.859
but we're going to separate them for teaching purposes.
