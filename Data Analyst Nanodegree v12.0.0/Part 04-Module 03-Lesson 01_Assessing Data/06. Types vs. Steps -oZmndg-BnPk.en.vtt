00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
There are two types or styles of assessing your data.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.484
You can assess it visually and you can assess it programmatically.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.733
Visual assessment is just opening it and looking through the data in its entirety,

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.339
in Pandas, a text editor or a spreadsheet application for example.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.125
This is what it looks like in Pandas for this animals.csv file,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.134
which has three columns; animal,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:24.235
body weight in kilograms then brain weight in grams.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:25.814
This data set's pretty small,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.655
but for larger data sets Pandas will collapse rows and columns.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.740
So in those cases, visual assessment is best

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.445
done in something like Google Sheets for example.

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.619
Programmatic assessment like its name suggests,

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:41.369
is anything that uses code to view specific parts of the data,

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:44.579
like using functions or methods to summarize the data.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.030
Like this dot info method for example.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.535
You can even plot the data,

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:51.529
but plotting isn't done very often when wrangling.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.715
This is more for exploring during exploratory data analysis,

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.170
which we'll get into later.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.545
Regardless of the type of assessment you're using,

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:01.554
assessing data can be broken down into two steps;

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.420
detecting an issue and documenting that issue.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.295
This process applies whether you're assessing your data visually or programmatically,

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:10.344
which are the two types of assessment again.

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:13.349
For example, we will visually assess the entirety of this data set in

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:18.179
Pandas and we detect that Gray wolf is spelt wrong, Gray woof.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.035
Then we document that issue with a bullet point.

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:24.224
I'd like to separate the issues by quality and tidiness.

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:28.155
So Gray wolf is spelled wrong, that's our documentation.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.409
This is simply what we see on observation.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.750
You don't have to write how to fix it which is part of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.674
the cleaning step in this data wrangling framework.

00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:38.554
So an observation would be,

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:42.765
Gray wolf is spelled wrong as opposed to something like change

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:47.000
Gray woof to Gray wolf which would be more of an action item rather than an observation.
