00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.495
Let's explicitly define the terms dirty data and messy data.

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:08.310
To help with this, think of your data like your bedroom.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.259
Everyone wants clean data like everyone,

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.359
or at least your mother wants a clean bedroom and this bedroom clearly isn't clean.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.250
It's both dirty and messy.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.149
A dirty bedroom might have dirty plates and cutlery,

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.029
garbage like candy wrappers or banana peels,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.560
maybe even physical dirt tracked in from outside.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.799
These don't belong in your bedroom.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.100
The messy part of the bedroom are different.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.670
Messiness is structural or organizational issues.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.155
Think clothes in the ground,

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:39.840
clothes belong in your bedroom but not in the ground.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.250
Or unmade bed, your bed should probably be made, that's messy.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.159
And data can be thought of in the same way.

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.519
Dirty data which has issues with its content is often called

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.095
low quality data and can include things like inaccurate data,

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:59.850
corrupted data and duplicate data.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.130
Messy data on the other hand had issues with its structure.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.490
It is often referred to as untidy.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.729
Tidy data means each variable forms a column,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.390
each observation forms a row and each type of observational unit forms a table.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.525
Any other arrangement is messy which is the exact term that Hadley Wickham,

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:22.535
the inventor of the tidy data format uses in his tidy data paper.

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:25.974
And again, here's what tidy looks like in comparison.

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:27.554
Just like you can clean your bedroom,

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.685
you can clean your data and it takes time and skill.

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:34.325
Fortunately, programming tools like Python and its libraries can help us,

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:36.530
like a vacuum might help you vacuum up dirt,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.034
or a dresser might help you organize your clothes.

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:44.000
Immaculately clean data is the goal and it's a beautiful thing once you have it.
