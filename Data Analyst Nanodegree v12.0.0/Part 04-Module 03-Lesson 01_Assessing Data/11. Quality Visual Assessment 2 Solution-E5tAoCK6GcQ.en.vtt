00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
So the first one here is this glaring typo in the given name column for David Gustafsson.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.699
David spelled D s v i d. As you can see in the contact column here his email has David,

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.559
so this is definitely a typo.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.710
So how could this have happened?

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.820
This is probably just another data entry error.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.507
And, why is it important to fix this?

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:20.040
Well, if you want to email or send mail to this person,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.174
if you misspelled their name that's not very nice for David here.

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:25.679
Again, that's if you're just sending email in

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.370
an automated fashion by picking at this name from this patient's table.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.109
So, time to document it.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.839
These treatments and patients table are starting to pile up here.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.000
So, let's separate these into sub-headers again.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.015
This data wrangling template can be adjusted as you see fit here.

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:40.771
It's not a rigid document.

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:50.849
Tweak it to your own personal preferences.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.875
So, the next issue is in the treatment table here.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.890
Specifically, the auralin and novodra columns.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.475
There are a few issues with this column but let's dial in on one right now.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:06.439
The fact that these dosages are documented in digit, digit, u form.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.209
So, for the first patient in this table,

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:13.004
the starting dose of auralin was 41 units and the ending dose was 48 units.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.369
These should actually be in separate columns but we'll handle that later.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.910
The fact that there's the letter u here attached to the end means that

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.137
Pandas would not be able to interpret this variable as a float or an integer,

00:01:24.138 --> 00:01:26.120
which is required for calculations.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.829
Because the letter u is there Pandas would force it to the data type object.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.704
Which is basically a string in Pandas.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:34.189
That means we can't perform calculations

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.495
using the starting and ending doses for each drug.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.840
That's a big deal. So, how could this issue have happened?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.475
Sometimes it's just poor planning on behalf of whoever's recording this information,

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.394
this clinical trial result data.

00:01:45.394 --> 00:01:46.759
Say if the person who was recording

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.965
this information was writing it down in a piece of paper.

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:51.740
Maybe they weren't aware that the data would be transferred from paper

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.054
to computer using something like optical character recognition,

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:58.233
which would pick up these Us and dashes here,

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.950
rather than simply the integer that we want.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.659
So, let's document this now. This is a big one to fix.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:12.710
And here's how the observation could be written.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.935
All right, so backup to the treatment's table.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.949
One other issue is that these given names and

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.824
surnames in the treatment's table are all lowercase.

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.264
Actually same goes for the adverse_reactions table.

00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:26.994
This is an issue because the patients table is not lowercase.

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.860
This becomes an issue if you want to join these tables later.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.695
Which I hint for later, I think we want to.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.264
This is probably a data recording or data entry error issue,

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:38.491
and we'll document this with observations.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.879
One for the treatment's table and one for the adverse_table.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.284
And, for the final one let's scroll to the bottom of the treatment's table.

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:53.504
There are 280 rows,

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:57.840
with last index being 279 because there's zero index to this data frame.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.164
So, if you recall the size of each treatment arm was actually 175 patients in each.

00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:08.400
175 for the auralin arm and 175 for the novodra arm.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.349
So, it looks like we're missing some data here.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.889
Finding where that data lives is a separate issue.

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.309
But we'll deal with that later.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.097
And for now we'll just document this with an observation.

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:24.700
We should have 350 total.

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.229
175 times-
