00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:07.769
You can fix quality and tidiness issues manually in spreadsheet programs or text editors,

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.399
for example, doing things like retyping incorrect data,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.160
or copying and pasting columns in rows.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.214
But manual cleaning is inefficient,

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:18.795
error prone and also demoralizing.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.670
You should never clean manually,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.650
unless the issues are one-off occurrences.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.129
Data cleaning is best done programmatically.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:27.869
This means using code to automate

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.620
cleaning tasks and minimize repetition, which saves you time.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.630
Data wrangling takes up a huge chunk of your time as a data professional already.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.969
So saving time wherever possible, is great.
