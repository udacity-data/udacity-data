00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.504
Say it with me. Data wrangling can be iterative.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:08.904
Hopefully that's drilled into your head now.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.645
So you just finished defining,

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:12.735
coding, and testing the cleaning operations.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.669
After cleaning, we always reassess our data.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.864
Then if necessary, gather more data.

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:21.929
Or make additional assessments and address them through another iteration of cleaning.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.949
You might proceed to analysis or visualization at this point.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.384
But it's also completely okay to revisit any wrangling step later too,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.120
if you realize it's necessary.
