00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
So you assessed and cleaned this entire clinical trial data set.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.120
Let's flash forward to the key point here.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.900
Is Auralin, the proposed new oral insulin, effective?

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.905
Again, that's a comparison to the injectable insulin Novodra.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.559
And here are the clinical trials key metrics.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.554
The first one here: Adverse reactions.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:22.634
For Auralin to pass this Phase II clinical trial it must be deemed safe,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.025
and the adverse reactions to it is encouraging.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.504
These adverse reactions were actually previously standalone,

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:31.199
but you join this to the treatments table to allow for this analysis.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.609
And here's what that adverse reaction column

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.924
attached to the treatments table looked like.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:38.984
Here are the pandas grouped by object.

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:42.329
Some of the common adverse reactions are cough, headache nausea,

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.239
a big one is hypoglycemia which is low blood sugar caused by

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.068
an insulin overdose, usually at least.

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:50.184
Between the two drugs, Auralin and Novodra,

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:53.155
the peer counts of each adverse reaction are pretty similar.

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:57.000
With the exception of throat irritation for Auralin, the oral insulin,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.009
which can be expected because this pill is taken

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.929
orally and passes by the throat before it gets to the stomach.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.230
And then injection site discomfort for Novodra which is the injectable insulin.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.189
And again, that's to be expected because that's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.509
a common known adverse reaction for injectable insulin because of needles.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.880
This is actually one of the big reasons why we want oral insulin in the first place.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.994
And these counts are more clear in these horizontal bar charts.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:26.040
This one for Auralin and this one for Novodra.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.537
And let's zoom out for that comparison.

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:38.588
Now the next key metric,

00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:41.944
Pre-trial Post-trial Mean Insulin Dose Change.

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:44.399
This is important because if the new oral insulin

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.093
requires a way higher dosage to be effective,

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:49.358
the manufacturer might not bring this to market.

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:52.090
Requiring massive doses makes things financially

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.370
infeasible and essentially an economic problem for the manufacturer.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.975
Even if this was effective and could improve lives,

00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:01.994
the drug industry is a business and it's an unfortunate reality sometimes.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:04.079
So you might recall that this dosage information was

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.614
actually hidden in two columns in this treatments table,

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:10.634
Auralin and Novodra, with start dose and end dose hidden in each column,

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:14.049
as well as the treatment value hidden in each column header.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.800
You separated out these start doses and end doses as

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.560
well as converting this from a messy to a tidy format,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.890
by melting the treatment variable down to its own column.

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.309
And the final product looking like this: treatment start dose,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.289
end dose, which allowed for this mean dose change analysis.

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.889
And again, the results here are good for Auralin or at least they're not bad.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.669
This negative eight's a bit misleading but it's just the way the numbers were set up.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.444
This means that patients that were treated with Auralin required on average,

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:45.150
eight more units of insulin to establish a safe,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.754
steady blood sugar level.

00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:51.569
That's compared to Novodra patients who on average required 0.4 units less of insulin,

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.219
comparing their start dose and end dose, pre-trial and post-trial.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.055
This isn't terrible, the fact that Auralin required eight more units,

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.305
this is kind of expected because we knew that

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:04.800
oral insulin had a tougher time in getting to the bloodstream through the stomach lining,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.390
and eight units more isn't that big a deal.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.984
And this difference in mean dose change is more evident in this bar plot here.

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.835
And again that's start dose minus end dose.

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:18.173
Okay, so now the key metric HbA1c change.

00:03:18.173 --> 00:03:23.145
Recall that HbA1c change is our key indicator for diabetes control.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:26.675
Most of our patients in this trial are starting around 7.9 percent.

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:30.300
And if we can establish that Auralin causes a reduction in HbA1c that's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.415
similar to the current injectable insulin standard, that's a success.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.909
And the way that's going to be measured is through

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.164
a confidence interval, which you'll see shortly.

00:03:38.164 --> 00:03:41.549
But the first step in getting that interval is establishing the difference in means.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.310
The difference in mean HbA1c changes that is,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.640
between Auralin and Novodra.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.300
And here's what the mean HbA1c reductions looked like before you cleaned.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.739
Recall that the big two aims of cleaning for

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.213
this HbA1c change column was filling in missing values,

00:03:56.213 --> 00:03:57.745
these NaNs here i.e.

00:03:57.745 --> 00:03:59.670
recalculating this difference.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.739
HbA1c start minus HbA1c minus end,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.741
which also address these inaccurate HbA1c changes,

00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:06.420
the ones that started with 0.9.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.789
Again, these were misrecorded by whoever wrote these down.

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.169
These 0.9s are actually 0.4s.

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.094
Before that cleaning, Novadra had a massive advantage in HbA1C reduction,

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:18.129
0.71 compared to 0.35 for Auralin.

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:22.000
That's a big difference. And here's what that looks like in bar plot form.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.673
A big advantage for Novadra,

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:25.665
but again that's before cleaning.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.100
So don't be discouraged yet.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.230
And here's what it looks like after cleaning,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.605
0.40 for Novadra compared to 0.39 for Auralin. That's much better.

00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:38.365
And again, that smaller difference in means is much clear in this bar plot.

00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:41.250
So these results are encouraging but clinical trial results

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.685
require more rigorous statistical analysis to confirm these.

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:48.180
And specifically the stat we were looking for was this upper limit of

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.079
the confidence interval between the differences in means being less than 0.4.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:55.064
Before cleaning 0.71 versus 0.35,

00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:57.105
clear difference in this bar plot.

00:04:57.105 --> 00:05:00.150
And it didn't pass our non-inferiority metric.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:03.044
The upper limit of the confidence interval is 0.43.

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:05.564
Without assessing and cleaning this clinical trial data,

00:05:05.564 --> 00:05:08.649
Auralin would not have passed the Phase II clinical trial.

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:11.459
After cleaning though, HbA1C reduction is pretty

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:15.449
similar and that's confirmed in the confidence interval,

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.534
the upper limit of 0.03 roughly is way less than 0.4, so that's great.

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:22.710
Oral insulin is similarly effective to

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:25.669
injectable insulin according to this clinical trial.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.400
So what does this mean?

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:31.635
This means our oral insulin passed Phase II clinical trials.

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.367
Phase II trials are the hardest to pass historically.

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.125
This is a big deal.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.925
Historically the probability of success for Phase II trials was 31 percent.

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.716
Past Phase II this means we have a good chance of making it past Phase III

00:05:44.716 --> 00:05:49.004
as well as the regulatory review process and having a good chance of making it to market.

00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:52.089
If it does, this oral insulin would be an enormous breakthrough

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.307
in treating Type I and Type II diabetes patients,

00:05:55.307 --> 00:05:57.909
as freedom from daily injections would liberate patients,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.265
help reduce missed doses and therefore reduce

00:06:00.264 --> 00:06:03.514
irritating and sometimes serious complications from diabetes.

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:06.139
Great job assessing and cleaning this data,

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.269
they were both vital.
