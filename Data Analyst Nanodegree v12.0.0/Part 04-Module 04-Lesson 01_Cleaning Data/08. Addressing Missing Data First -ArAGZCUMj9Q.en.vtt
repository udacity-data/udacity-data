00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.504
It's usually best to find missing data first if you can.

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.415
In other words, completeness issues,

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.140
which is a part of data quality.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.277
Sometimes you can't though, and that's fine.

00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:10.855
But if you can find that missing data,

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.230
concatenate, join, impute, whatever.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.050
Get it all intact there so the subsequent cleaning operations you

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.208
perform on those columns or rows won't have to be redone i.e.

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:21.909
not filling in the missing data,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.615
then cleaning some rows and columns with missing data,

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:28.635
then joining that missing data in later and having to redo those cleaning operations.

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.509
So for our clinical trial dataset here,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.679
we identified three completeness issues.

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.304
Two in the treatments table,

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:36.465
the missing HbA1c changes,

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.400
and the missing records having 280 instead of 350,

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.659
displayed here in the visual assessment.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.969
Then one missing data issue in the patients table,

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.820
the missing demographic information all displayed here

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.210
through the.isnull method on the patient's address column.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.390
Address, city, state, zip code, country, and contact.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.045
Contact being phone number and email address.

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.535
So we can't address this third issue,

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.964
the missing demographic information.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:05.520
Sometimes you just can't, you're stuck.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.159
We really have no way of getting this information from these people.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.744
Because we don't know where they live,

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:12.480
their phone number, or their e-mail address.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.900
We can't contact them.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.305
We could skim the phone book or the internet for their contact information,

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:20.080
but it's probably most efficient to hold off until they come back

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.170
into our office or the hospital for example.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.504
We can clean the other two issues though,

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:27.099
the two in the treatments table.

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:30.099
Missing HbA1c changes and the missing records,

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.629
280 instead of 350. Let's get to those now.
