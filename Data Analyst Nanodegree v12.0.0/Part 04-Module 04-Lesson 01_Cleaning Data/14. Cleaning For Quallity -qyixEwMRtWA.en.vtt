00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Once the missing data and tidiness issues are cleaned,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.615
cleaning the remaining data quality issues, i.e.

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:09.469
the ones outside of the completeness issues is all that remains.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.585
And there were a lot of data quality issues in this dataset.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.515
19 in total and 16 outside of the missing data issues to be exact.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:21.745
Next you'll use a variety of common pandas functions to clean them all.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:23.914
This is a hefty task but you can do it.

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:27.660
We're on the home-stretch here and we're so close to clean data that we can use to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.549
analyze and hopefully recommend oral insulin as a viable insulin treatment for dia.
