00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:05.355
You completed our lesson on cleaning data,

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.725
the third step in the data wrangling process.

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.640
That also means you've reached the end of our data wrangling course.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.013
Congratulations. In this lesson,

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:17.190
you converted your assessments from the previous lesson and defined,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.525
coded, and tested cleaning operations for them.

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:23.853
You cleaned to improve quality and you did it efficiently using things like loops,

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:26.039
functions, and regular expressions.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.559
You also cleaned to tidy the data set using pandas's tidying functions, like melt.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.384
That was a lot of cleaning and the code required wasn't a piece of cake.

00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:37.454
You should be proud of yourself and excited,

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.719
because everything you cleaned represents

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.759
the vast majority of issues you'll encounter in the future.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.835
And congrats on completing the course once again.

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:49.024
You're a certified data gatherer, assessor and cleaner.

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:50.905
Since so much of the world's data comes

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:55.410
dirty and messy and so much new data is being produced every day,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.000
you'll have plenty of opportunities to apply your new wrangling skills.
