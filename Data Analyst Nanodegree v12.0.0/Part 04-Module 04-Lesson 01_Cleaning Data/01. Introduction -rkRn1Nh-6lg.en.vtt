00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.910
Now that you know how to gather and assess data you're going to master cleaning it.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.425
Cleaning your data is the third and final step in the data wrangling process.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.540
This is where the quality and tidiness issues you

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.239
identified in the Assess step are remedied.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.405
It can be done manually in spreadsheet programs or text editors,

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:23.010
but data cleaning is often best done using code and in three steps.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.250
First you define how you're going to clean issue in words,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.829
then you convert these words to code,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.144
and finally test your data to make sure if that code worked.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.080
Watching your data transform to clean feels like magic sometimes.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.409
In this lesson you'll take your assessments from the last lesson and

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.114
define, code and test cleaning operations for each.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:46.289
You'll also become intimately familiar with

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.935
the cleaning and testing functions in Python and the pandas library.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.859
At the end the lesson we'll flash forward to analysis and

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.359
visualization and you'll see how cleaning was absolutely necessary.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.594
You're going to leave with the tools required to clean

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:02.609
pretty much everything you come across in the future.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.334
And since it's the last lesson of the course,

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.049
you're also going to leave an expert data wrangler.
