00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.929
Think of programmatic data cleaning as its own separate process within data wrangling.

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.739
It also has three steps: defining, coding, and testing.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.050
First, you'll define a data cleaning plan in writing.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.890
You convert your assessments into cleaning tasks by writing little how-to guides.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.795
Think of this like pseudo code.

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:26.320
In the future this plan also serves as documentation so

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.670
others or yourself in the future can look at your work and reproduce it.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.025
Second, you'll translate these words to code and actually run it.

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:37.420
And finally, you'll test your dataset often

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.690
using code to make sure your cleaning code worked.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.449
This is kind of like a revisit of the assess step.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.859
Similar functions are used too.
