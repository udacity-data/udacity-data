00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.850
When I was a kid, I used to read these books called Choose Your Own Adventure.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.840
And the idea of Choose Your Own Adventure is that you are the protagonist and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.590
you get to make choices about what to do at various points along the storyline.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.270
And based on what you do, you get sent to another page.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.200
You get to see what happens as the results of your choices.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.740
And in that spirit, for this final lesson,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.930
I'm going to have you choose your own algorithm to investigate.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.110
We've given you your first three and hopefully a little bit of a structure for

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.970
how you can approach them.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.420
Now we're going to guide you through doing it on your own.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.750
And in the future, as you become a more advanced machine learner,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.260
you'll be doing this on your own all the time, so this is your first chance to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.310
leave the nest and to find about a new algorithm on your own.
