00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.120
So you successfully learned about three different supervised learning

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.780
algorithms, now it's time for the fourth.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.510
But this time, we won't prescribe one for you.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.720
&gt;&gt; That's right. We're going to give you a choice of three, and

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.270
it's up to you to figure out which one you want to pursue on your own.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.270
&gt;&gt; And what are the choices?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.170
&gt;&gt; The choices are, k nearest neighbors.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.330
Very simple, very straightforward algorithm, a great one to know.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.035
Ataboost.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.420
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; Very powerful and random forest.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.990
Those, those latter two are usually used with decision trees,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.020
which you know all about by now.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.570
&gt;&gt; Do you have a favorite?

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.350
&gt;&gt; I like eta boost.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.920
&gt;&gt; Eta boost girl.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.870
&gt;&gt; I love eta boost, yes.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.470
&gt;&gt; So you're going to go out and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.410
check on the documentation, pick an algorithm and run it, and report results,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.340
and see if it can beat any of the algorithms here in about so far.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.640
&gt;&gt; That's right, let's get started
