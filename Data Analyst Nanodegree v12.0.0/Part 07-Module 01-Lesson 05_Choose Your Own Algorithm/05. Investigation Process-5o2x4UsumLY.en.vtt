00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.860
Here's the process I want you to follow.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.910
It has several steps.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.080
The first is to take the name of your algorithm and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.060
head on to Google to do some research.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.100
Get a general understanding of what the algorithm does.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.930
If you can explain the algorithm to a friend, for example, then you

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.810
probably understand it well enough that you're ready to move on the next step.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.980
Then what I suggest you do is find the sklearn documentation for

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.790
this algorithm, exactly the way we've been doing all throughout this course.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.580
Remember that the sklearn documentation also usually has examples.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.750
This would be a huge help for

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.970
you in the next step, step number three, which is to deploy the algorithm.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.980
Get your hands dirty.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.070
Try to get it running at least.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.696
That's, of course, the first thing that you need before you can go on to

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:47.748
step number four, which is using it to make some predictions about the test set.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.580
And then, of course, you use those predictions to evaluate it.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.890
What's the accuracy on the test set?

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.480
I've given you set of starter code that has all the training and

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.280
testing data ready to go.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.130
There's also a function in there that allows you to plot it, so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.840
you can visualize the decision boundary,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.080
which is always something that's really nice to do.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
By the time you've completed this process, you will be a real machine learning

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.440
expert in the sense that maybe you don't know everything yet.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.130
The very few machine learning experts would say they know everything.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.270
The thing that separates the good ones from the great ones

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.270
is very often that they're able to go out and learn something new,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.880
and this is your chance to do that.
