00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.970
So here we are back in the self driving car.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.090
Katy, what have we learned this unit?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.800
&gt;&gt; We've learned so much, we've come so far.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.430
We've learned three supervised classification algorithms.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.630
And we've also learned a lot of things that are more higher level than just

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.290
the algorithms themselves.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.380
We've learned about bias and variance.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.336
These are two extremely important ideas in machine learning.

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:24.765
We've learned about over-fitting.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:26.681
We've learned about the parameters.

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:28.105
How you can take an algorithm and

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:31.240
make it look completely different just using the parameters.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.600
We've covered a lot of material.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.660
&gt;&gt; That sounds so amazing.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.050
So when you get to it like in [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.530
What really makes a great machine learning researcher?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.440
&gt;&gt; A great machine learning researcher is someone who's really excited and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.620
curious and adventurous and they have a lot of questions and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.440
they really want to answer them.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.400
And what it does when you have this attitude is, it makes you go out and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.960
find the way that you can answer the question that you have.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.760
And you have a really great start with the stuff that we've taught you.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.440
But there's a lot of stuff that we haven't taught you.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.670
Machine learning is a gigantic topic.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.510
And a great machine learning researcher is somebody who goes out after this and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.680
tries stuff on their own.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.890
That's how you learn.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380
&gt;&gt; So my last question.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.250
I have a hunch. Is this what the next unit is all about?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt; Your hunches are usually correct, Sebastian, and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.090
in, in this case it is again.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.160
In the next unit, we're going to be talking about data sets,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.190
we're going to be talking about questions.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.300
We've talked a lot about algorithms that are very important, but

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.990
at the heart of it machine learning is about the data that you have and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.850
the questions that you're trying to answer with it.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.560
And we're going to really dig into this topic.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.990
And I'm very excited.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.620
We have a new dataset we're going to be looking at.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.110
It's the Enron dataset.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.320
It's a really interesting case of emails and

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.400
fraud, and we're going to be taking a really deep look at this dataset,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.450
trying to figure out what we can get out of it.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.930
That's totally amazing, I guess we'll see you in class.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.180
&gt;&gt; I hope so, we'll see you in class.
