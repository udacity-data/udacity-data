00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.520
Here are a few prerequisites that will make you maximally successful in

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.110
this course if you have them.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.470
The first is programming experience, especially in Python.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.660
We'll be making a lot of use of machine learning libraries that are available to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.290
us in Python.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.740
And so, when we go in and we start to look at the code,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.320
we'll be really zeroing in on the machine learning parts of it and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.140
not particularly the Python programing aspects of it.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.870
So that should be something that you're fairly familiar with already so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.680
that you don't get stuck at, at the programing aspects of this class.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.320
The second thing is that you should have a little bit of

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.380
familiarity with statistics.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.250
We mostly assume that when we introduce the statistics concept, we'll,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.010
we'll give you an explanation of it and some intuition.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.630
But if you've taken something like Udacity's descriptive and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.570
inferential statistics, then you'll be right on point to,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.940
to follow along closely with this class.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.670
In addition to that, you should have a wicked sense of curiosity, and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.670
you should be really excited about solving interesting problems and,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.740
and using, getting your hands on really interesting data.
