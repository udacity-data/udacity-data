00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.710
Hi, my name is Sebastian Thrun.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.120
&gt;&gt; My name is Katie Malone.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.770
&gt;&gt; And this is the machine learning class here at Udacity for

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.050
everybody to learn machine learning.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.320
I am a research professor at Stanford.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.660
I am the founder of Udacity and

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.290
I also did things like Google Self Learning Car, The DARPA Self Driving Car,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.300
Challenge Ways, Google Street View, Google Glass, Google X.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.760
And the secret behind my work is, it all reduces to machine learning.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
Machine learning is the core of what I do and machine learning enables me

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390
to build amazing products and amazing user experiences.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.720
&gt;&gt; I'm a physicist by training so I have a little bit of a different background.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.721
But in physics we use machine learning all the time too.

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:37.852
And so what we do, is we start with gigantic data sets of lots of

00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:40.400
particles that we create in our detector.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.313
And we use machine learning to comb through those huge data sets and

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:44.571
to find the one event.

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.019
Or the ten events out of the millions and

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.480
billions that help us win Nobel prizes.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.120
&gt;&gt; And doing good machine learning is just like making great wine.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.800
So I have a bottle of wine here from Italy.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.800
the, analogy goes as follows.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.170
If you want to, going to make a really great wine you have to make great grapes.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.220
And if your grapes are no good, your wine is no good.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.500
Same is true for machine learning.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.000
You need good data.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.540
You need to really understand your data really well.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.980
And then there's a technique to it to make really great wine and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.590
it's really hard to learn.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.220
Same is true for machine learning there's a technique to look at data,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.560
to understand data, to be able to apply algorithms.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.500
And if you don't master the technique you

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.090
will never be a great machine learning person.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.940
&gt;&gt; So in this class, in our machine learning class we're going to start

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.940
with a bunch of machine learning algorithms.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.530
But we're also going to be looking at some really interesting datasets.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.120
And we're going to be asking some really interesting and kind of hard questions.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.690
But questions that we think are going to be really cool to answer.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.340
So we're going to start from raw data, and then we're going to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.398
show a machine learning process that sort of goes from beginning to end.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.240
So that you can start with a dataset of your own.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.080
And you know how to tackle it using machine learning.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.740
We are here in Silicon Valley.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.590
And in Silicon Valley machine learning is a big deal.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.120
Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Google and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.760
many others use data on a daily basis to optimize the product experience.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.230
And I can tell you, if you're proficient in big data and understand data

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.480
science really well, you will find a job in Silicon Valley, very likely.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.930
And the starting salaries are unbelievably high.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.369
They are often north of $150,000 to an $200,000.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.054
&gt;&gt; And even if you're not looking for a job in data science right now.

00:02:10.054 --> 00:02:13.022
There's still probably lots of ways that machine learning is something

00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:14.050
that you use everyday.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.710
So when I go on Netflix at night.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.650
How do I figure what, what movie I'm going to watch,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.250
Netflix makes recommendation using machine learning.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.900
When I use my credit card, to make a purchase.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.680
There's fraud protection on it, that's machine learning as well.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.830
You're get some insights into how all kinds of tools that you use

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.740
everyday are working, and they're built on top of machine learning.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.930
&gt;&gt; This is a really great class.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.540
&gt;&gt; It's learning by doing.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.770
We'll see you in class.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.790
&gt;&gt; We'll see you in class
