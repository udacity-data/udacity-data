00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.200
Let me tell you a little bit more about the format for this class.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.850
We'll have a lot of lessons that are interspersed with quizzes quite liberally.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.880
So you'll have a chance to practice the ideas that we're teaching you

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.540
as we're teaching them to you.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.200
In addition to that, we'll have mini projects at the end of each lesson.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.920
And in my opinion, this is where most of the learning will happen.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.760
This will be where you get your hands on the keyboard and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.430
you actually practice coding up the things that we're teaching.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.040
And to that end, it's very important that you have a computer that has

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.860
Python working on it because that's what you're going to need in order to

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.870
complete those mini projects.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.180
At the end of the class, we'll have a final project that ties together

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.290
pieces from a lot of those mini projects into one big machine learning analysis.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.430
And this is really cool and really exciting.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.570
And this will be the way that

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.120
you know that you've learned something really concrete and really fantastic.
