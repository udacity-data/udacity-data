00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.120
So here we are in the heart of Silicon Valley at Google.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.620
Machine learning is all over Silicon Valley.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, here at Google we're using machinery for, obviously for search, for

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.950
ranking the little pages that you going to see, for speech recognition, for

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.770
language translation and of course, for self driving cars.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; One of my favorite examples is a little bit more trivial than that, but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.394
I think it's really fun.

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:25.362
There is a company in Silicon valley that I actually tell it what clothes I

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.601
like, and then it'll figure out what my tastes are and

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.394
it'll sell me new clothes so I don't ever have to go shopping gain.

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:31.459
&gt;&gt; It is a machine learning algorithm?

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:33.350
&gt;&gt; It is a machine learning algorithm.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.005
It is. &gt;&gt; So how did you have to train it?

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.067
&gt;&gt; It's really good, I didn't have to train it that long.

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.977
&gt;&gt; Wow. So is there a 10% bonuses?

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:39.574
&gt;&gt; I think, there probably, there should be, right?

00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:40.794
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Here we go.

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:44.420
So Day, age of big data, yeah?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.620
And, there is no company within a 10 mile radius that wouldn't use big data,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.490
including Udacity, to optimize its products.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.220
&gt;&gt; So, that's what we'll be learning about in this class,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.360
there's all kinds of interesting examples here.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.350
And, we'll go in great depth into a few questions in this class, but you should

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.060
always be thinking about interesting problems that you'd like to solve, and

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.550
how machine learning can help you out there.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.500
&gt;&gt; And look, if you do a great job.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.550
We do our best to find you a job here in Silicon Valley.
