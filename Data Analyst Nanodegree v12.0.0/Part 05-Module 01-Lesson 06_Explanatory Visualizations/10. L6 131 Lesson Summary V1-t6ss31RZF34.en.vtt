00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.690
Congratulations.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.205
You've reached the end of this lesson on Explanatory Visualizations.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.220
In this lesson, you learned about how to go from

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.880
exploratory visualizations used to discover insights for yourself

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:23.384
to explanatory visualizations used to communicate those insights to others.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.690
You reviewed elements to polish your plot, including good design,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.835
proper plot and encoding choices,

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.759
and good labeling and plot context.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.119
You saw how to present your findings using a slide deck

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:40.009
and how to use feedback to improve your visualizations.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.280
Explanatory Visualizations are a key component of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.880
your communication at the end of an analysis project.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.035
The saying that a picture is worth a thousand words is apt here.

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.919
Better than text alone, a good explanatory visualization

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.175
will help you convey your findings and impress your audience,

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:02.129
be it a friend, boss, or the world.
