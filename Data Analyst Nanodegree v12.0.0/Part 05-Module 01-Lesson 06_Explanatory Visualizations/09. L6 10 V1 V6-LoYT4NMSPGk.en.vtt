00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.179
Even if you try to follow the plot choice and design guidelines

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.855
expressed in this course, it may be difficult to tell for certain

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.765
whether or not you have an effective visualization.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.649
If you're uncertain about whether or not your explanatory visualizations

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.729
are conveying the story you want to tell and even if you are confident,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.414
it's never a bad idea to make use of feedback from others to guide your designs.

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:34.365
A friend, family member, or coworker can all provide feedback.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:37.820
You don't need someone with visualization experience.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.094
After you've created version of your visualization,

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.549
ask them what they think was the main point of the visualization.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.809
See if they have any questions about the data or if there is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.679
something in the visualization that they don't understand.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.429
Based on the feedback, you'll have valuable information

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.715
to continue to improve the clarity of your message.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.970
The fresh perspective provided by your test reader may

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.929
reveal things that you missed when you are putting the visualization together.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.290
Irrelatively making improvements with the help of others in

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.830
this way will make your visualizations the best that they can be.
