00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.815
Explanatory visualizations are primarily about conveying a message or story.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.048
They should grab your reader's attentions,

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:18.015
and clearly convey a message that conveys a specific feeling or a call to action.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:22.230
In order to most effectively tell the story and engage your audience,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.660
you want your plots to be polished.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.365
Many aspects of polished explanatory visualizations,

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:31.214
have already been covered in previous lessons.

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:33.780
These include choosing an appropriate plot and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.865
encodings and paying attention to design integrity.

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:41.750
The previous lessons haven't explicitly covered one aspect of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.640
explanatory visualizations, context information.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.960
On your axes, make sure you place appropriate labels and sufficient tick marks.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.054
Generate legends that describe non-positional encodings,

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:58.039
provide a title on your plots, and accompany them

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.589
with comments or additional text.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.370
All of these elements will provide your readers with a direct path

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.180
to understanding what your visualization is telling them.
