00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
In this video, I'll show how to use

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.519
jupyter's nbconvert tool to change this notebook into a slide deck for presentation.

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.019
This notebook summarizes some observations from

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.629
the car mileage dataset from earlier in the course,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.475
focusing on the relationship of CO2 emissions to other features in the data set,

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:19.480
including engine size, and fuel mileage.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.109
In order to prepare the notebook for conversion,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.954
we need to assign each cell to a specific type of slide element.

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:28.924
To do this, click on the view menu option,

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.274
move to cell toolbar, and select slideshow.

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:34.954
You'll see a drop-down in the upper right corner of

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:38.655
each cell to assign each cell a slide type.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:40.545
For the markdown slides,

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.664
I will assign the slide type.

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:46.019
These will show up as the main flow of the slide deck.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.395
For the code cells, I'll do one of two things.

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:51.150
For cells like the first two,

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.369
we're undoing things that aren't really important to the presentation.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.320
I'll assign them to skip so that they won't be rendered in the output.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.579
The other cells that generate the visualizations will be set as subslide types,

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.239
and will be seen after their parents slides.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.699
After doing this and saving the notebook,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.540
I stop the notebook server and return to the terminal.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.005
To perform the conversion,

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.054
I input the following command.

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:18.100
The two option specifies the HTML slides output format,

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:19.789
while post serve will open up

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.295
an HTTP server to render the slides immediately after conversion.

00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:28.689
You can see the slide deck now rendered using reveal.gs.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.769
The left and right arrows onscreen,

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.394
or with the keyboard., can be used to move between main slides.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.649
For slides with child subslides,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.605
you can use the up and down arrows to navigate between them.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.049
You'll notice in the visualization slides that

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.780
the code has been rendered in addition to the visualization.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.924
We'd rather this code not be visible in the presentation.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:49.954
To accomplish this, we can specify

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:54.034
a Jinja template file to generate the slides in the format that we desire.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:56.238
This page by Damian Avila,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.130
one of the contributors to nbconvert,

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.229
has an example of a template for hiding

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.469
the input cells when rendering a notebook as slides.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.574
I've made a local copy of this code as output_toggle.tpl,

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:11.889
and put it into the same folder as my notebook.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.269
Now, when I use nbconvert,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.295
I add an additional option, template output_toggle.

00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:21.905
The slope slides now only show the visualization outputs,

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:26.099
and withhold the code inputs unless I click on the output.
