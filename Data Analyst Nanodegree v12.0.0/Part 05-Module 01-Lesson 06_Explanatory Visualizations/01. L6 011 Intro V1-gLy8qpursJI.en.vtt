00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.269
There are two main reasons for creating data visualizations,

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.320
exploratory analysis, and explanatory analysis.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.554
In previous lessons in this course,

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.390
you've learned about exploratory analysis.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
Exploratory analysis is done when you are searching for insights in your data.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.570
The visualizations you create in this stage, don't need to be polished,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.505
they only need to convey information for you to answer your research questions.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:36.175
This lesson, we'll focus on explanatory analysis,

00:00:36.174 --> 00:00:39.664
which is done when you communicate your findings to others.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.140
These visualizations need to emphasize

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.070
the key messages that you want the viewer to understand.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.545
Compared to exploratory plots,

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.840
explanatory plots should be polished

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.520
so that their purpose is clear and easy to obtain.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.070
When someone looks at your visualization,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.975
you may not be there in person to explain things.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:03.289
The goal of explanatory visualization is to make sure that

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.935
your reader's interpretation matches what you want to convey.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:11.010
You'll learn best practices to do that in this lesson.
