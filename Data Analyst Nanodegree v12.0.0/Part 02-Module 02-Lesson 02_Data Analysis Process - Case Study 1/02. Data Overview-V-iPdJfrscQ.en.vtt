00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
In this lesson, we'll be analyzing two datasets.

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:08.279
One, on red wine samples and the other on white wine samples from the north of Portugal.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.539
Each wine sample comes with a quality rating from one to ten,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.609
and results from several physical chemical tests.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.309
That may sound like a big word,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.594
but it just means we'll be analyzing properties like alcohol content,

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:22.244
acidity level, and residual sugar.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.810
Here are the two data sets in a Jupyter notebook.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.315
One at the red wine samples, and one of the white.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:30.358
Not including the index column,

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:33.320
there are 11 columns describing their chemical properties,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.140
and a column for the quality ratings.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.509
If you are the owner of a vineyard or a wine store and you're given

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:43.420
this data on almost 5,000 wine samples, how might you use it?
