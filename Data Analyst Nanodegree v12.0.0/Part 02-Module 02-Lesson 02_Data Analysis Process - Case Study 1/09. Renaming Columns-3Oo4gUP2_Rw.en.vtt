00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
In order to get the append statement to work correctly,

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:05.744
we need to rename the column in red_df,

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.655
so that it matches the column name in the white_df.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.279
To rename our columns in the previous lesson,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.149
we set df.columns to a new list.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.115
Right now, we just need to change one of the column labels.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:19.559
If we try to do that by setting one value of

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.954
df.columns by indexing it like this, we get an error.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.209
Index does not support mutable operations.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.410
This just means, that this column label array is something we can't modify.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.000
And since we can't modify it,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.460
we'd have to reassign the whole thing to a new list like this.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.289
Although this worked, this seems like a lot of work to change just one column name.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.579
We could do this better by using a method called rename.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.960
Look at the Stack Overflow page and try renaming

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.000
the columns with this method in the Jupyter notebook in the next section.
