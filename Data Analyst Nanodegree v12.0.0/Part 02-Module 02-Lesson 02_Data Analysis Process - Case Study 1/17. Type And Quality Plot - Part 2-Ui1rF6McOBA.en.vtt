00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.125
Although, this visual shows us that

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:05.679
the white wine samples has slightly higher average quality ratings,

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.870
it would be nice if we could get more details on where that's coming from.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.594
Let's put a more detailed bar chart,

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.280
counts for each quality rating by color.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.649
We can groupby quality and color to do this.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.009
Because these are counts,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.600
the values for all the columns will be the same.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.340
So we'll just pick an arbitrary one.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.820
That's close, but there are several things that can improve at this plot.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.939
First, there's clearly more white samples than red samples.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.414
So it's hard to make a fair comparison, we just count.

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:42.615
To balance this out,

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:48.135
let's divide each count by the total count for that color to use proportions instead.

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:50.924
That looks a lot better.

00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:53.684
We can see that for the lower ratings: three, four and five,

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:55.775
red samples show higher proportions,

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:57.579
and for the higher ratings: six, seven,

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.829
eight and nine, white samples have higher proportions.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.314
The data we're showing looks great,

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:05.054
but the tick labels on the X axis look messy,

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:09.425
and it would be nicer to have the red and white bar for each rating next to each other.

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:13.159
We're also missing a spot for the red samples with a quality rating of nine.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.685
Although that number is zero,

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:16.674
that spot should still be there.

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:19.448
Since there seems to be a lot of customization needed,

00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:22.939
it would make more sense to plot directly on Matplotlib than with pandas.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.000
Before we move on, let's learn more about Matplotlib.
