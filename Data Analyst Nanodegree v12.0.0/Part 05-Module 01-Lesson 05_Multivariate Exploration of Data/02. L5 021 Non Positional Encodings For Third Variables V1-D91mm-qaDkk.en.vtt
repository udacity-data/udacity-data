00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.030
Consider this scatter plot showing

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.009
the relationship between interest rate and loan amount.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.875
How might we show how borrower rating or monthly payment relate to these variables?

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.449
One option we have in this case is to use different encodings on

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.039
the points to indicate the value of one of these variables on each point.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.439
The type of encoding that is most useful for

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.315
the additional variable will depend on if it is qualitative or quantitative.

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:37.204
Let's take a closer look at three encodings: shape, size, and color.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:41.170
Shape is a good encoding for categorical variables.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.760
Since there's no natural order of shapes,

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.234
this is an especially good choice for nominal type data.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:52.174
Here, the borrower rating is indicated by one of three shapes on the plot.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:54.399
You can see that for a given loan amount,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.789
interest rates for borrowers of class A tend to be lower than those of B or

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.179
C. Size is an encoding that is often used for numeric variables.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.085
In this plot, you can see how the monthly payment

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:10.109
is derived from the loan amount and interest rate.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.935
A larger point size indicates a larger payment.

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:17.120
When using size, it is important to pay attention to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.035
the mapping between the variable's value to the size of each point.

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:25.545
For example, these points associate radius with value.

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:31.219
However, this has a distorting effect since it is the area of each point that stands out.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.799
A point with doubled value ends up with

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.834
four times the area, a disproportionate representation.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:42.584
It is more common for area to be associated directly with value.

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:47.539
Sometimes, different functions might need to be used so that all points remain readable,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.385
similar to how you might perform an access transformation.

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:55.950
The most common third variable encoding you will see is color.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.350
Color can be used for both qualitative and quantitative variables.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.329
This is a large topic that deserves

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.439
its own focus and will be covered in the next segment of the lesson.
