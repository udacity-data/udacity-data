00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:06.569
In the previous lessons,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.980
you learned how to use univariate and bivariate plots to visualize your data,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.040
one or two variables at a time.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.764
In most of these cases,

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.929
you use position like in scatter plots,

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.410
or length like in bar charts for encoding your variables.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.379
This is because our perception for values is most precise with these encodings.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:29.769
This presents an issue for when we want to move on to multi-variate plots,

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.469
or plots of three, or more variables.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.734
There will be ambiguity in value,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:39.994
if we try to embed three positional dimensions into a flat, two-dimensional image.

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:44.449
Take for example this point on the three-dimensional axes here.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.600
What does that point's value on x, y, and z?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.164
Due to perspective, there are multiple possible values it could take.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:56.554
We can resolve the ambiguity with additional markings,

00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:00.034
but this is unreasonable if we have lots of data.

00:01:00.034 --> 00:01:03.379
In this lesson, you will learn about encodings that can be

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.575
used to create effective multi-variate plots.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:09.650
You will also see other techniques like fastening

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.370
that can expand on bivariate plots to make them multivariate.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.640
You will also learn about additional techniques that will help you in your analysis.
