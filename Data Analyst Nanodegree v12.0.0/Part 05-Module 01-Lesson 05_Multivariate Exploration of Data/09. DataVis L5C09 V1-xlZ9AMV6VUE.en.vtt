00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
To close this lesson out,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.469
I want to make a quick reminder that feature engineering is

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:07.934
an option when performing an investigation into your data.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:13.320
In this video, I'm going to look an example of biases in Pokemon creatures statistics.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.570
More specifically, I want to know if

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
a creature's offensive stats are biased towards physical or special-attack,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.945
if their defensive stats are similarly biased towards physical or special defense.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:29.144
To do this, I will create new variables based on ratios.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:33.594
The attack ratio column is the ratio between attack and special-attack.

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:35.839
If a creature has a value greater than one,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.690
then they favored the physical side,

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.890
and if less than one, they favor the special sides.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.945
I do the same thing for the defensive statistics.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:46.774
The basic scatter plot looks like this.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:48.949
Let's polish things up by adding

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.240
some transparency and then changing the axis scales to log scales.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.630
That way a bias of two to one is evenly spaced from

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.570
the even ratio of one in both the physical and special directions.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.079
Next, I'll add some tick marks appropriate for a log scale.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.834
Finally, I'll set the axis limits to remove the extreme outliers.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:15.579
These particular limits also centered the plot on one on both axes.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.075
In the final plot, we see that most points seem to fall along a diagonal line.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:21.814
In the upper right-hand quadrant,

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:25.640
we have Pokemon species that are physical biased in both offense and defense,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.409
and in the lower left-hand quadrant,

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.189
they are special biased in both offense and defense.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.109
Interestingly, there appears to be a large number of Pokemon

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.290
on the y equals one line showing no defensive bias.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.710
These Pokemon have a wide range of offensive biases.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.199
There appeared to be much fewer Pokemon on the x

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.005
equals one line showing no offensive bias.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.810
Findings like these would be difficult to come by and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.870
summarize if we didn't build our engineered features.
