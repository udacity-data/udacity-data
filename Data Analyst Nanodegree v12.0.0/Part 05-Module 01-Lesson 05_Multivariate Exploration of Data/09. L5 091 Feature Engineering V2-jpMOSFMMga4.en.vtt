00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.160
One additional technique that you will find useful

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.449
for exploring your data is feature engineering.

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.829
In feature engineering, you create

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.839
new variables as functions of existing variables in your data.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.370
As an example, let's say that we have

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.285
some summary statistics for the number of crimes that occurred in four different regions.

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:31.054
This initial bar chart suggests that the east region has the highest incidence of crime.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.600
However, this doesn't take into account

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.469
the population for each region which can be seen in this chart.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.729
The east region also has the highest population.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.219
The higher number of crimes may simply be

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.204
a natural correlation with the number of people.

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:49.759
We should compute a ratio between these two variables,

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.974
such as the number of crimes per 100,000 people.

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:56.505
If we create this variable and then generate a new chart,

00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:00.359
we can see that the North region has the highest crime rate.
