00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:07.479
After positional encodings,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.714
the next most important encoding to know about is color encodings.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:16.655
Color can be used for both qualitative and quantitative values.

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.530
You've already seen this in the previous lesson.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.914
Numeric counts were encoded with color and heatmaps,

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:27.679
while categorical labels were encoded with color and clustered bar charts.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.045
Depending on your type of variable,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:33.060
you should be inclined to use a different color palette.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.365
Here, I'll discuss three major palette types: qualitative, sequential and divergent.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.425
Qualitative palettes are geared towards nominal data.

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:46.449
These palettes tend to consist of

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.825
distinct hues with fairly similar brightness and saturation.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.900
This way, no ordering is implied and

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.869
individual levels aren't applied as more important than others.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.479
Sequential palettes should be used for ordinal and numeric data.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.500
In a good sequential palette,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.590
low values are indicated by lighter,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.385
less saturated colors, while high values are indicated by darker, more saturated colors.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:15.195
Sometimes, this is flipped the other way around;

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.879
light for high, and dark for low.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.829
Usually, a single or small range of hues is used.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.995
For certain ordinal or numeric data that have a meaningful center point,

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.425
a diverging palette can be used.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:30.590
A diverging palette is essentially

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.564
two sequential palettes with distinct hues put back to back,

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:36.304
with the connecting color at the center point.

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:40.100
One hue will indicate values greater than the center point,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.744
and the other hue values smaller than the center point.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.969
There are a couple of things that you should check even

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.370
after selecting a palette, regardless of type.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.329
First of all, be mindful of hue choice and account for color blindness,

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.844
especially in qualitative and diverging scales.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:02.965
If you want to use opposing colors like red and green in the same plot,

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:05.150
try to make sure that they can be distinguished by

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.910
those with color perception deficiencies.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.604
The red and green shown on the top are too close in brightness and saturation,

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:15.643
while those on the bottom are more distinct.

00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:19.930
Secondly, try and avoid transparency on top of color.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.349
If points of different color overlap,

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.530
this can create uninterpretable new colors.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.509
If points of the same color but different saturation overlap,

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.250
this can create an altogether new,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.319
and incorrect value to be perceived.
