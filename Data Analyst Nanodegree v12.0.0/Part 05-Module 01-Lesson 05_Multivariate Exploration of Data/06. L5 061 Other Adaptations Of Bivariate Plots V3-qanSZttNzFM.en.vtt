00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.094
In the previous lesson,

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.349
you saw how histograms and bar charts can be adapted into

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.855
bivariate plots by changing the count axis to indicate the mean of a second variable.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:20.280
We can follow a similar approach for heat maps and clustered bar charts,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.554
to change them from bivariate plots into multivariate plots.

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:27.890
For example, let's take this heat map

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.390
regarding shots made over a series of basketball games.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.215
X and y positions are relative to the basket which is at the origin.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.095
In this multivariate plot,

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:39.969
the color shows the third variable,

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.494
how accurate shots were in each region of the court.

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:47.354
Darker colors indicate a higher proportion of shots made.

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:49.640
You can see that very generally,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.509
the shots that were closer to the basket had a higher chance of making it in.
