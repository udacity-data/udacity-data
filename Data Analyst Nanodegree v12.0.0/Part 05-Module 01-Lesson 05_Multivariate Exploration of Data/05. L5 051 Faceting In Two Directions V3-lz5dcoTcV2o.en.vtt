00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.620
Use of additional encodings is not

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.300
the only way to include a third variable in a multivariate plot.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.649
One other way of adding an additional dimension to plots is through the use of faceting.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.234
When we facet univariate plots by levels of a second variable,

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.009
we get a bivariate plot.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.470
When we facet bivariate plots by levels of a third variable,

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.519
we get a multivariate plot.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.089
Earlier in this lesson,

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.320
you saw the multivariate scatter plot of interest rates by loan amounts,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.399
with different borrower classes indicated by different point shapes.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.879
One alternative way that we could have displayed the data is by

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.225
faceting by the categorical variable like this.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.660
Separating each borrower class into its own subplot.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.729
We aren't limited to faceting by only one variable.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.114
We could also choose to facet plots across two variables,

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:59.289
one on the rows, and one on the columns.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.179
If we had known period as another variable,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.439
then we could facet the data by rows in addition to the classes by columns.
