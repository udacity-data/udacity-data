00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.919
As part of your bivariate exploration,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.719
you might be interested in relationships between lots of variables.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.570
You could explore these relationships two variables at a time,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
but there are other techniques besides multi-variate plots to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.964
explore multiple pairwise relationships at the same time.

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:23.625
In a plot matrix,

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.804
a grid of plots is generated.

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:31.000
Unlike a faceted plot where each subplot is based on one subset of the data,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.698
each subplot in a plot matrix is based on the whole data,

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:37.820
but with two different variables on the axes.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.659
Each row and column corresponds with one variable.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.184
For example, this plot shows the relationship between sugars and fats.

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:51.745
Along the diagonal, the row variable and column variable match up.

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:57.500
A univariate plot of each variable is usually placed along this diagonal line.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.929
A plot matrix is good for getting

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.829
a broad overview of pairwise relationships between variables.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.569
Considering that the size of each subplot will be fairly small,

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.229
a plot matrix is best as

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.805
an initial exploratory tool to lead you to points of further interest.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.685
You should follow up a plot matrix by generating

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:20.225
additional plots of specific variable sets on their own.

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:22.879
We can also adapt heatmaps to depict

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.114
the pairwise correlations between variables in our data.

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:28.039
Like the plot matrix,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.425
each row and column corresponds with a single variable.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.759
The value and color depicted in each cell is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.880
the correlation between the corresponding row and column variables.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:41.449
This is another good summary option for

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.280
exploration when starting with a lot of variables.
