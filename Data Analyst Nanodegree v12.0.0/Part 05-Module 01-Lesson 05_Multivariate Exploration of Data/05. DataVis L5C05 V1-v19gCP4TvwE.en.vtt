00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.389
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.609
we used faceting to plot fuel efficiency on different vehicle class subsets.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.350
Faceting can be extended to

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.679
multivariate cases by having each facet be a bivariate plot instead.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.410
From the code we started off with,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.410
we can just change the mapping parameters,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.254
a scatter plot instead of histogram and two axes variables instead of just one.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:23.234
You can see the efficiency outliers and the compact,

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:25.039
midsize, and large classes,

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.585
as well as the slight bias towards smaller engines

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.315
in the mini and subcompact car classes.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:33.564
We're not limited to only facet by one variable either.

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:37.519
If we add a row equals trans type argument to the facet grid,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.765
we separate each vehicle class by automatic and manual transmissions.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:43.685
When we have two facet variables,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.905
the titles get a little bit unreadable.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:47.780
The simplest way to alleviate this,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.969
is by setting margin titles equals true in the facet grid call.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.350
This moves the row levels to the right side of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.600
the facet grid leaving the column labels on top.
