00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.310
Congratulations.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.900
With the skills you've learned,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.449
you now have proficiency with data visualizations

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.824
from single variables through multiple variables.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:19.289
In this lesson, you learned about a number of techniques

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.814
to create effective multivariate visualizations.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.429
For single plots, encodings like shape, size,

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.600
and colour can illustrate values for additional variables.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.745
Faceting, allows you to plot

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:37.750
multiple simpler plots across levels of one or two other variables.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.539
You also saw how heat maps could be used for multivariate visualization,

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.435
substituting count for measuring a third variable.

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:51.355
You also learned about techniques to help your exploration and analysis.

00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:54.949
Plot matrices and correlation heat maps allow for

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.310
a high level look at pairwise relationships between your variables.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.225
With feature engineering, you can generate

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:06.980
additional features to strike a complex relationships in your data.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.885
Most of the materials thus far,

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:13.329
have been focused on the exploratory side of visualization.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.890
In the next lesson,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.269
you'll learn how to polish up your plots and make them

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:20.950
part of explanatory analysis and communication.
