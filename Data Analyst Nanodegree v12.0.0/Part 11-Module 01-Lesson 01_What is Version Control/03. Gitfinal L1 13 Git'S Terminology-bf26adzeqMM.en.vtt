00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
When I was first learning Git,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.985
one of the hardest things for me to pick up on were all the various terms that were used.

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:10.150
For those of you that see a big long list of terms and zone out,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.109
don't worry, just skim the list for big picture ideas.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.364
If you're like me and like knowing the terms that are being used,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.139
then this section's for you.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.310
These terms are the vocabulary we use to talk about version control,

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:24.195
features of a version control system,

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:28.875
changes we like to make to our code while it's in a version control system, and so on.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.585
Some terms are, well,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.155
version control system, source code manager, commit,

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.125
repository, repo, checkout, working directory, staging area,

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:38.639
the index, staging index, SHA, branching,

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.435
merging, merge conflicts, remotes.

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.785
Get these things out of here.

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:46.314
So yeah, the terminology can be a bit overwhelming.

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:48.989
There are a number of good handouts around the web, though,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.545
but I've created one for you that lists

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:55.234
the most important terms along with a brief definition as a companion to this course.

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:58.530
I highly recommend that you download this right now.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.965
Place it on your desktop, or print it out and have it on your desk.

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:05.335
Use it as we progress through the course to review key terms.

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.199
At first, the words might not make any sense

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.409
because this is one of those chicken and egg scenarios.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.733
Should I learn the terminology first or how to actually use Git?

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.149
I think it's easiest if you learn Git if

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.900
you have some familiarity with the terms it uses.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.989
In addition, it might be helpful for you to create your own cheatsheet.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:24.570
If you get stuck on a word or idea, just write it down.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.139
So if you get a handle on version control's somewhat foreign terminology,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.290
you're already a giant step towards becoming a Git master.
