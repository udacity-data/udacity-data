Great job setting up your computer to use GIT.

00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:07.405
Going through this lesson you laid a solid foundation to start learning version control.

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:11.490
We looked at the benefits of version control and how incredibly helpful it can be.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.595
You also looked at the terminology that version control systems use.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.025
And you did download the terminology document, right?

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:21.974
It'll be extremely helpful to have on hand as you go through the remaining lessons,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:26.355
and last you installed GIT and got everything configured. Fantastic work!

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.469
Really, a lot of people get bogged down with

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.859
all this stuff and never actually learn version control.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.729
So congrats on getting this far.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.059
Now let's head to the next lesson to learn how to create a GIT repository.
