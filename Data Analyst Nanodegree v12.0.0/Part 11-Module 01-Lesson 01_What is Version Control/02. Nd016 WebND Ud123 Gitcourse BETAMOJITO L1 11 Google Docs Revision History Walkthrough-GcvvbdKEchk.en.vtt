00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
Here's the outline for this course you're taking right now.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.919
Let's click on this link to get to its revision history page.

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:10.108
This main part shows the document that we see in

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:15.169
the normal view but this sidebar provides all the awesome features we want.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.449
This is the history of the changes made to this document.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.030
They're organized by date and show who made the edits.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.579
Clicking on one of these will swap out

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.320
the current version of the document with an older one.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.550
Let's click on the October 13 version.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
The main area now shows the version of the document as it appeared on October 13.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.140
It also provides these arrows to let us jump to the edits that were made.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.493
The highlight color indicates which user made the edit.

00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:46.700
If I like this older version of the document,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.920
I can replace the current version with this older

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.274
one by clicking the Restore this revision link.

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:54.664
One last thing is that Google Docs will group

00:00:54.664 --> 00:00:57.689
lots of changes together in one larger group.

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.048
If you want to see smaller sets of changes,

00:01:00.048 --> 00:01:03.658
that's what the, Show more detailed revisions button does.
