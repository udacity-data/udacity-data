00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.583
When a commit is made,

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:06.320
only the changes that are on the staging index are moved into the repository.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.330
If we want to include the second set of changes in the commit,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.359
then we need to stage the changes.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.858
Now that the second change to the HTML file has been staged,

00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:19.350
the two sets of changes to the HTML file are combined into just one set of changes.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.950
And then we can commit like normal to move these changes into the repository.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.644
We have all of these changes saved in our repository,

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:28.039
but how do we access these commits?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.344
What if we want to look at this specific commit?

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.919
When each commit is made,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.899
git creates an ID for it.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.278
The ID for the commit is its SHA,

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:41.230
the first seven characters what each commits SHA might look like.
