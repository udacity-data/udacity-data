00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.944
At its core, git records changes to files as commits.

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:06.599
These commits are all saved in a repository.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.359
Everything else, things like the working directory branches and

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.349
SHAs are there to help make and reference commits.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.239
As you've seen the terminology that version control uses is kind of cryptic at first.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.579
Hopefully you had the hand out with you and reviewed it as you

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.594
went through the high level overview of how git it is used.

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:27.204
In the next section we're going to install and configure git.

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:29.159
Make sure to follow each of the steps in order

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.070
so that your computer will be configured like mine.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.530
Now, configuring your terminal isn't required

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.594
for git to work correctly or to continue with this course.

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:39.933
You can do the entire course without this step,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.794
but not only does it make it easier to use,

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.260
all professionals reconfigure their terminal.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.820
The reconfiguration we'll be doing will add color to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.975
the terminal and display specific git information.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.000
Sounds good. Let's get to it.
