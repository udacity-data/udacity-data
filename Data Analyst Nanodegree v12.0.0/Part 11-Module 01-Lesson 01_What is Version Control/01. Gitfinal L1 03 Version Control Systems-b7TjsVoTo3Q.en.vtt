00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There are a number of version control systems out there,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.004
but three of the most popular are Git, Subversion and Mercurial.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.599
Not only are there dozens and dozens of different version control systems,

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.974
there are actually two different categories.

00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:17.850
There's the centralized model and then the distributed model.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.849
In a centralized model there's one all powerful central computer that hosts the project;

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.815
every interaction must go through this central computer.

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:30.405
In the distributed model there's no central repository of information.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.600
Each developer has a complete copy of the project on their computer,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.368
which is cool because that means you can also work off line.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:39.534
In this course we'll be using the version control system Git,

00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:42.993
which is a distributed version control system.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.009
Now, you might have heard of Git hub.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.884
Git and GitHub are quite different.

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:49.810
Git, is the version control tool,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.635
while GitHub is the service that hosts Git projects.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:56.844
To work with Git projects you're not required to use GitHub,

00:00:56.844 --> 00:00:59.350
but it's an awesome tool and you should definitely check it out.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.539
For now, you can think of it as basically,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.540
just another computer where you can upload a copy of your project.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.879
Centralized, distributed, if these

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.454
don't make a lot of sense right now, that's totally fine.

00:01:09.453 --> 00:01:13.048
This is to give you a big picture idea of where things fit together.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.954
These terms are more important if you're working with a team but

00:01:15.953 --> 00:01:20.000
you'll be working locally on your computer for the entirety of this course.
