00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
Here are the configuration file that I've downloaded and unzipped.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:06.890
I need to move these files into the home directory.

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:09.509
The easiest way is to right click on the window and

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.914
choose Git Bash Here from the list of options.

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:17.364
This option shows up because I've already installed Git on this machine.

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:21.000
In the shell, just type cd and press enter.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.164
This moves the shell to the home directory.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:25.235
To open this director in Windows Explorer,

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.934
type start and a period.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:31.070
I like being able to jump to this directory,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.710
so I'll pin this to the quick access menu.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.490
To do that right click on quick access and choose "Pin current folder to Quick access".

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.585
Now let me shift these windows around to organize them better.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.335
Now that we have the home directory open,

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.590
we can move the configuration files over.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.465
Select both items and drag them to the home directory window.

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:54.135
They're in the correct location.

00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:56.644
Now they just need to be named correctly.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:00.550
Both files need to have a dot at the beginning of their names.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.589
Since Windows rename feature doesn't allow that,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.659
we have to do it on the command line.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.914
We'll use the mv command to rename bash_profile to.bash_profile.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.160
We'll do the same thing with the folder.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.859
We'll use the mv command to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.209
rename you udacity-terminal-config to.udacity-terminal-config.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.939
To see the changes we'll have to open a new shell.

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:27.613
So the shell is now configured with the correct content,

00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:31.230
but I also like having a white background with black text,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.855
so I click in the top left corner of the app,

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:37.350
choose options, and then update

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:43.243
the foreground color to black and the background color to white.

00:01:43.243 --> 00:01:46.430
Perfect. Now everything is configured.
