Hello and welcome.

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:04.605
Today we'll be learning all about version control,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.620
and we'll be using the version control tool

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.199
Git to help us manage different versions of our project.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.809
Now, before we dive into some of the nitty gritty details,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.199
let me tell you a story, because who doesn't love story time?

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.044
Back in the day, my brother and his best friend would play games all the time.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:24.325
But, one of their favorite board games was a popular World War II strategy board game.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.919
The board game shows a map of the world,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.679
and you put pieces on the board and move them around.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.630
I didn't really care for the game all that much because it would take so long to play.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.565
Sometimes, they'd be playing a single game for a day or more.

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:38.958
Now, because there's a big board with lots of pieces that move around,

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.365
if they had to pause the game,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.245
they would snap a picture with their phone.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:45.009
They'd use these pictures as save

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.799
points in case anything happened to the board or the pieces,

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.779
like someone bumping the table or the dog

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.590
coming along and knocking the pieces everywhere.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.950
If there were a problem,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.660
they could use a picture to recreate

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.889
the exact setup and jump back to that point in the game.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.395
So each of these pictures is a save point.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.137
The pictures record the time,

00:01:03.137 --> 00:01:06.670
who took the picture, and the state and location of the pieces.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.680
This idea of a save point is exactly what version control does.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.955
You don't seem all that impressed.

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:17.659
Well, let me tell you that it's incredibly powerful and I

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.978
love having it because when you use version control,

00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:23.825
you create safe points that save your project.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.350
This let's you have the freedom to change absolutely anything about

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:29.559
your project and be confident that nothing will be lost.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.448
Total security and total freedom,

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:32.834
who wouldn't want that?

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.334
And you get all of that with a version control system.

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:37.058
Sounds pretty awesome, right?

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:38.515
So hi, I'm Richard,

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.870
and I've been using version control for years,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.785
and Git has saved me from countless sticky situations.

00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:47.289
For example, one time I'd realized I deleted an important image,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.790
but I was able to recover it because the project was being tracked with version control.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.030
It's an incredibly helpful tool and you'll grow to depend on it as much as I do.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.579
You ready to get started?

00:01:57.578 --> 00:01:59.000
Awesome, let's get going.
