00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.374
I've downloaded the files and unzipped the directory.

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:07.513
In the Terminal, I'll type cd to make sure I'm in the home directory.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:09.525
Using the move command,

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.794
I'll move the udacity-terminal-config directory into my home directory,

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:17.969
but I also want to rename it by adding a dot at the front.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.018
Since the Terminal is in the home directory,

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:27.659
I'll move this directory into the home directory and name it.udacity-terminal-config.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.056
The bash_profile file also needs to be in my home directory,

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:34.034
but this is a very common file and if I already have this file,

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.750
then I don't want to overwrite it.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.863
I'll use ls -a to check if I already have one.

00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:45.959
I already have a bash_profile file,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
so I'll open it up in my code editor.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.594
Now that I have this file open,

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:59.879
I just need to copy the text out of here into this file.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:10.419
Now just save the file and I'm done.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.915
If you don't already have a bash_profile file,

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:17.400
then you'd use the move command to move this file into your home directory,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.984
making sure to name it with a dot at the beginning.

00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:24.545
But I'm not going to run this because I already have updated my.bash_profile file.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.013
Now even though I've updated my bash_profile,

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:28.996
nothing's changed with the Terminal.

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:32.561
That's because I need to restart it.

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.469
So here's what your Terminal should look like.
