00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.020
Let's say a few words about types of data.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.300
It's something that's come up in this class already, but let's make it

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.000
a little bit more explicit so that you know that it's something to look out for.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.870
Here are a few important types of data that you should be aware of.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.270
One is numerical.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.090
So something like salary information would be an example of

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.500
a numerical variable, where basically the feature is a number.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.810
Another thing that we've talked a lot about in the context of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.670
supervised classification is categorical features.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.790
These can take on a limited number of discrete values.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.630
So, a cat, an example of a categorical feature would be the class label.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.540
This would also be something like if a person is a man or

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.970
a woman, or maybe how many stars you give when you're rating a movie.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.700
Although stars, you might argue, could also be called a numerical value.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.353
Another one that's very important, especially in particular fields like finance,

00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:50.509
is time series data.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.178
This is data that has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be

00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:58.059
something like a date or a time stamp that you can look for trends in time.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.870
One that we're already very familiar with, text data,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.070
which is basically just words.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.900
A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.370
into numbers using some interesting functions that we'll,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.170
that we'll learn about, things like the bag of words formulation.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.440
So these are all types of data that you might encounter, and depending on

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.820
exactly the type of data, this might have some repercussions for the type of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.030
algorithm that you can use or the type of questions that you can ask of it.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.090
So let me get you a quiz just to practice this.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.580
I'm going to give you a bunch of types of features you might see and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.790
ask you what type of data that feature is.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.710
First example is salary information.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.030
Would you call this numerical, categorical, time series, text, or

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.680
let's put other on the list as well because this isn't a complete list.
