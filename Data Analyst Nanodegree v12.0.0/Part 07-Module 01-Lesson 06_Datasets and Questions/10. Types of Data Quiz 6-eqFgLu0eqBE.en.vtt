00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.948
And this one is maybe a little bit tricky.

00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:03.490
You might have said other, but

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.370
I would actually argue that this is a type of text.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.220
It's not words maybe in the most classic sense, but it's words of

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.450
a very specialized vocabulary, where the vocabulary is email addresses.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.720
And so, text wrangling tools might be one of the more better ways to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.650
deal with email addresses.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.710
Great job. Now that we've gone through all these examples of types of data,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.230
hopefully you have a good sense for what might be some interesting features to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.710
look for and what type of data those features are.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.020
Now obviously, not everything we talked about here is something that's going to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.180
be available to us in the email corpus.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.620
For example, salary information is very,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.400
very interesting, but it's not going to show up in your email inbox.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.820
So now, let me tell you a little bit more about the data set that we've made

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.540
because I haven't been totally honest so far.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.340
We do have a lot of emails, but

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.360
there's some other very interesting stuff that we have available as well.
