And the last one is the to and from fields of the emails.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.200
So if I send a list to five different people,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.580
it will be those five email addresses.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.130
That could be a very interesting feature for persons of interest.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.510
Maybe they send lots of emails to other persons of interest, and

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.410
that's one way we could figure out who they are.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.570
What type of data would that be?
