00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.310
So Katie this is about Enron.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.890
Tell me, what is the Enron story?

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, the Enron story is so interesting.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.510
The Enron story is the largest case of corporate fraud in American history.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.220
&gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; That's what it is.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.290
So Enron was an energy trading company, that, in around the year 2000 or

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.420
so, was one of the top ten largest companies in America, huge company.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.550
They had their fingers in all kinds of different projects,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.820
and by the middle of 2002, it was gone.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.480
It was bankrupt, there were dozens of people in jail, there was billions of

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.560
dollars, tens of thousands of people's jobs that were, poof.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.170
And as you might suspect when something like this happens, a multibillion dollar

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.530
company just collapses, it didn't happen totally organically.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.140
There was a lot of fraud that was going on underneath the surface.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.300
In some ways, it was amazing that the company didn't go bankrupt even

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270
earlier than that, considering how much fraud was going on.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.120
&gt;&gt; Well, that's, that's super interesting.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.900
So why is it relevant for this class?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.610
&gt;&gt; It is relevant for this class because, as it turns out, Enron has had, sort

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.590
of, a second life in the form of one of the most famous data sets of all time.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.910
And the data set that we'll be using, sort of,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.380
to motivate a lot of our projects in the rest of this class.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.580
Its called the Enron Corpus, and its tens of thousands of emails.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.710
Hundreds of thousands of emails.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.510
&gt;&gt; So real emails by real people?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.615
&gt;&gt; Real emails by real people.

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:22.370
It's one of the, as far as I'm aware,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.360
the biggest corpus of emails that sort of exist in the wild.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.580
&gt;&gt; That exist in the open, I guess.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.690
&gt;&gt; In the open, that's right.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.600
Because emails are usually so confidential, right?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.930
And so, it's been used for many, many different purposes.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.510
And we'll be using it to answer a very interesting question in this class.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.290
I want to use this corpus to try to figure out if

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.550
there are patterns within the emails of people who were persons of interest in

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.800
the fraud case to see if you can identify those patterns.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.910
&gt;&gt; So these are likes real emails for real people-

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.258
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if they have an affair, you'll find it in the email and

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.633
their misappropriate money, you'll find it in the emails.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:55.212
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:56.090
&gt;&gt; So you're going to see all this.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, you can, you see everything.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.530
In fact, one of the things that was very interesting to me as I

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.300
was learning about sort of the Enron fraud case.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.350
And I was reading newspaper articles and watching, watching documentaries.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.530
You get a sense for some of these individuals and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.480
exactly the roles that they were playing in this fraud.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.890
And as you go in and actually read their emails is a very weird experience.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.250
So, yes, it's, it's real.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.930
&gt;&gt; So that's the case of the past, right?

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.320
But this machine learning is about the future.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.310
Why is it interesting to go this email corpus and find panels of fraud?

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.350
Like who would care?

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.740
&gt;&gt; The thing that I love about this project is while this data set has been

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.370
out in the world and very famous for the last decade or

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.400
so, no one's ever actually tried to answer this particular question.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.990
Can we identify patterns in the emails of people who were-

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.950
&gt;&gt; Who would care about this?

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.550
The NSA, are you working for the NSA?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.270
&gt;&gt; I care about it, I think it's a really interesting question.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.060
&gt;&gt; That's the thing is it,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.230
is it, this is at least, for my case, it's a, it's a case of curiosity.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.410
Of course, if you were a some kind of forensic, machine learning expert,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.170
you might, this might actually not be a, a case of the past for you.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.260
You might be really interested in trying to answer this question and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.880
might have real world implications.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.740
For me, I'm just, I'm just perversely curious.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.470
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.789
So Katie, you've done experiments on the data already.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.429
&gt;&gt; I've done a lot, yes. &gt;&gt; On your own so-

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.090
So what do you do, what worked, what didn't work?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.400
&gt;&gt; Well, that's basically going to be what I'll be teaching for

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.300
the rest of the class.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.780
I'll be, a lot of the projects all of the mini projects,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.300
in fact, are going to be coming back to this Enron corpus.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.420
As I'm trying to understand things about it.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.120
And using different machine learning techniques to attack it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.590
from different angles.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.000
I've done a lot of smart things, and I've done a lot of very stupid things, and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.470
I've learned in the process of, of, this this exercise.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.330
So one thing that I will be doing also from here on out is pointing out some of

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.230
the places where I've done something that, that I didn't realize at first but

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.150
was kind of stupid.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.070
And how I figured out what my mistake was and how I caught it.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.310
So my hope is that this is a little bit of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.210
watching a machine learning exercise in practice.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.750
That in some ways, I am two steps ahead of you, kind of macheteing my way

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.060
through the jungle, but that the students are there, one step behind me.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.390
And they're sort of watching my thought process as its unfolding.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.660
As I'm trying to answer this question.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.810
&gt;&gt; What do you think the students will learn from this data,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.055
and where do you think they can apply it?

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:20.110
&gt;&gt; It's an incredibly rich data set, and there's a lot of

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.930
places where we'll be talking about things that have broad application.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.240
So the things we'll be addressing in this coming few lessons, for

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.720
example, we'll be talking about regressions.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.870
So using regressions, I was able to understand the relationship between

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.330
the salaries of the people in Enron and their bonuses.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.770
And see if there are any interesting relationships there.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.530
As it turns out, I'm not sure that it has a lot of implication for

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.190
the fraud, but it was something that I found very interesting.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.380
We'll be looking at clustering.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.620
You can use clustering on the data which is a, a type of unsupervised learning.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.560
It's a very interesting algorithm to figure out who within this

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.310
within this organization was a member of the board of directors and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.250
who was just a regular employee.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.160
We'll be using outlier detection and

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.680
removal to find certain lines in the data set that were bugs basically.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.760
That were outliers, that I had to go in and clean out manually.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.370
To make sure that we were getting sensible results from our data.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.380
Stuff like that.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.940
&gt;&gt; Great, great.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.410
And students will they basically be watching you do this?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.320
Or will they do it themselves?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.220
&gt;&gt; A little bit of both.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.180
There are places where there's something that I would wrestle with for

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.870
many days at a time before I finally figured out what was going wrong.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.330
So my hope is that they will not be wrestling quite as hard that,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.190
as I've learned some of these things, I can point them in the right direction.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.170
But for the most part,

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.860
it will be replicating the steps that, that I've been following and

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.260
coming up with the answers to the questions that I've been curious about.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.135
&gt;&gt; And in terms of the skills of student learn by doing this,

00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:47.484
the skills that they can take on in their professional lives.

00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:48.790
Like, what are other examples?

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.770
Because the Enron data set is like, one in a decade.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.610
And it's a specific one that was made public for some specific legal action.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.140
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.750
&gt;&gt; Like, what other things, today, can the students use it for,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.910
once they've taken this specific example?

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.030
Well, it's, a lot of the topics that we'll be covering will

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.640
be using Enron as a use case.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.620
But of course, that's not the only use case for any of these things.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.380
So let's use the example of clustering.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.670
So I said that clustering will be using to identify the difference

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.930
between people on the board of directors and ordinary employees at Enron.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.060
But clustering is something we have an interview with a vice president in

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.230
Netflix, who is very involved in their machine learning.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.730
And in Netflix, what they do with clustering is they actually identify

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.130
particular types of people by their movie choices.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.350
And so they can have clusters of users that they say, here's, here's the,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.520
whatever 25 to 35 year old men who like to watch action movies and comedies.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.554
Here's the children who like to watch Disney movies.

00:06:46.554 --> 00:06:50.145
Here's the women who like to watch romances and these, based on these clusters,

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:52.972
they can figure out who their, yeah, who their customers are.

00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:56.850
&gt;&gt; So you're telling us by analyzing the email of a fraudulent organization and

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.220
then many years ago, you learn about movie preferences of people in Netflix?

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.360
&gt;&gt; By using the same algorithms, yeah, it's not too,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.970
it's not too much of a stretch.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.850
because there are many different questions that you can be asking, and

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.090
machine learning is a tool that you're going to be using to answer them.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.950
So whichever, whichever direction you point that fire hose in is-

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.460
&gt;&gt; That, that, that's really exciting.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.220
&gt;&gt; I'm, I'm very excited about this.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.460
And there's one thing that I, I do want to emphasize.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.920
Which is that what we're trying to do with this data set identifying persons of

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.660
interest in the fraud, it, it hasn't ever been done before, as far as I'm aware.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.940
And we picked it because I think it's a really cool problem.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.420
Not because I know that there's an answer that's easy to find.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.060
And so I, I think it's very important that that point be

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.030
made because it's there's lots of things out there that would be easy to solve.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.590
And this isn't one of those cases, and in fact, at the end if there's a student

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.500
who gets very into this and really starts to dig into the data on their own,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.580
it can very easily become more of an expert than, than I am right now.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.120
So I really hope that there are students out there who get

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.610
as excited about this as I am and, and make it their own project,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.760
start to engineer their own features, come up with their own ideas, and

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.690
figure out how to implement them because while I'm setting a good example,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.750
I'm getting you off to a good start, there is no way that I'm covering

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.210
all the smart ideas that could solve this, right?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.860
&gt;&gt; This is great.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.710
Thank you, Katie.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
