00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.950
Another feature that might be really interesting to look at is the number of

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.030
emails sent by a given person.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.150
As it turns out, this is a feature that we'll have to write ourselves.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.380
It doesn't come to us straight out of the data.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.460
We have to look at the data and actually build this particular feature

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.660
ourselves, but that is one we will take a look at.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.770
What type of data would that be?
