00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.950
If I want to be able to identify persons of interest in the Enron dataset,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.270
of course, a really important thing to do is to define what I

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.610
mean by a person of interest.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.170
So I thought about this for awhile and

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.510
I came up with a few different things that might define a person of interest.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.480
Maybe they were someone who was indicted,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.620
which means they were charged with a crime.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.970
Another possibility, and there were several people like this, is that

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.900
a person of interest could be someone who settled without admitting guilt.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.060
So that usually means that they paid a fine, but there were no criminal charges.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.240
And they didn't admit that they were involved in the fraud in any specific way.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.312
It's a little bit of a judgment call whether you should include these people, so

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:42.550
that I would have as many examples as possible of persons of interest.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.270
And then the third possibility is a person of interest could be someone who

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.300
testified for the government in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.500
Now I want to show you a list I made of all the persons of interest that I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.190
was able to identify.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.120
So in this poi.txt file, I just have a list of names.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.160
This first line here is actually an article that I found very helpful in

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.520
trying to identify all the people who were persons of interest.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.580
And it was interesting because this was really a manual problem,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.370
to come up with this list.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.670
In all the examples that we've done so far, you just kind of have the data

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.700
handed to you and it already has class labels assigned, so it's really simple.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.490
But here, what I had to do was actually go out and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.220
figure out who should be assigned the class label of person of interest.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.572
So all those people, I found their names using newspaper articles basically and

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:30.791
I wrote them all down.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.793
You can see that there were quite a few of them.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:36.414
This is consistent with it being one of the largest corporate fraud cases in

00:01:36.414 --> 00:01:38.110
American history.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.290
All told, I counted about 35 people, 30 of whom or so worked for Enron.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.120
The rest were working at other firms, but they were doing business with Enron.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.890
And one thing that I want to point out is that this list might not be perfect.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.850
I made it by hand and there's completely the possibility that I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.430
missed someone or I missed several people.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.890
And so, in the videos to come for

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.140
the rest of the class, I'll show you what I did, but I'll also try to

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.920
point out places where it's possible that mistakes could sneak in.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.389
So you should always be skeptical of the things that I find and

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.490
you should try to check them out yourself.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.450
So, if you're really interested, go through this list and see if

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.980
you can find anyone else who should be on it, and if so, post it to the forums.
