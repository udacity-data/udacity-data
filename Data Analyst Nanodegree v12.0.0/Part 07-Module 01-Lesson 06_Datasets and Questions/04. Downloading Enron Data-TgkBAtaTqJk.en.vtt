00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.770
Now that I've defined a person of interest it's time to get our

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.840
hands dirty with the dataset.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.910
So here's the path that I followed to find the dataset.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.370
I started on Google as I always do.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.760
My Google for Enron emails.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.860
The first thing that pops up is the Enron Email Dataset.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.630
You can see that it's a dataset that's, that's very famous.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.350
Many have gone before us in studying this for many different purposes.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.980
It has it's own Wikipedia page.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.630
It has a really interesting article that I recommend you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.000
read from the MIT Technology Review about the many uses of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.680
this dataset throughout the years.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.240
But the first link is the dataset itself.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.510
Let's follow that link.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.400
This takes us to a page from the Carnegie Mellon CS department.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.030
It gives a little bit of background on the dataset and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.389
if we scroll down a little ways.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.700
We see this link right here.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.990
This is the actual link to the dataset.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.260
Below that is a little bit more information.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.960
If you click on this it's going to download a TGZ file.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.880
Which you can see I've already downloaded down here.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.830
If you do this on your own.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.050
It took me nearly half an hour to download the whole dataset.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.810
So I recommend that you start the download and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.030
then walk away to do something else.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.440
Once you have the data set you'll need to unzip it.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.340
So move it into the directory where you want to work and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.240
then you can run a command like this.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.820
There's no real magic here I just googled how to unzip .tgz and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.170
found a command like this.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.530
Again this will take a few minutes.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.170
When you're done with that you'll get a directory called enron mail.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.210
And then CD into maildir.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.870
Here's the data set.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.680
It's organized into a number of directories, each of which belongs to a person.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.260
You see that there's so many here I can't even fit them all on one page.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.630
In fact, you'll find that there's over 150 people in this dataset.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.530
Each on is identified by their last name and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.260
the first letter of their first name.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.850
So, looking through on a very superficial level, I see Jeff Skilling.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.110
Let's see if I can find Ken Lay.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.450
Looks like he might be up here.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.050
Yep, there's Ken Lay.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.730
Of course, a whole bunch of people I've never heard of.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.270
And remember, my question is,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.330
how many of the persons of interest do I have emails from?

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.070
Do I have enough persons of interest, do I have their emails,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.680
that I could start describing the patterns in those emails,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.538
using supervised classification algorithms?

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:10.639
And so the way that I answered this question was,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.980
again, using some work by hand basically.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.710
I took my list of persons of interest and for

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.660
each person on that list I just looked for their name in this directory.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.590
Let's go back to that, remind ourselves what it looked like.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.020
You can see the annotated list here.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.540
You might have been wondering what these letters were before each of the names.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.460
These are my notes that I wrote to myself.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.750
As to whether I actually have the inbox of each of each of these people.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.800
So Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling we already found.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.594
But then it started to become a little more difficult.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.630
So you can see there are many, many people than I have n's next to their name.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.750
And that means no I don't have, for example, Scott Yeager.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.850
If I go over to the dataset, I don't see a Yeager down here.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.430
So Scott Yeager is a person who I'd love to have his inbox.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.490
I'd love to have some emails to in and from him, but I don't.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.400
As it turns out, I don't have the email inboxes of a lot of people.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.070
So I'll be honest,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.890
at this point I was actually really just discouraged about the possibility of

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.270
using this as a project at all.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.880
I think I counted something like four or five people that I had their inboxes.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.150
And while that might be a few hundred emails or something like that.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.210
There's really no chance that with four examples of persons of interest I

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.760
could start to describe the patterns of persons of interest as a whole.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.830
In the next video, though, I want to give you a key insight that I

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.280
had that gave this project a second chance.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.900
A different way of trying to access the email inboxes of

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.920
the persons of interest.
