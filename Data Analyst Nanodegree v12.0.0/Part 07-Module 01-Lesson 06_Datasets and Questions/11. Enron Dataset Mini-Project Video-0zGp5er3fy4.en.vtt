00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.430
Welcome to the mini-project on data sets and questions.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.112
This is where you're going to get your hands on the Enron data for

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:08.949
the first time, and this is going to serve as sort of the backbone for

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:09.943
the rest of the class.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.170
We want you to get good and familiar with it.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.410
I think this is a really fun lesson because this is where you get to go in and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.800
actually figure out who were all the players, how much money were they making,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.370
who was sending emails to who, stuff like this.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.060
So in this mini-project, I'll provide you with the data set and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.180
then ask you a series of questions that help guide you through how to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.590
navigate through the data set and extract some of the information.
