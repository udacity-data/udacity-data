00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
From the last video and quiz,

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:04.259
you now have a logistic regression model.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.779
In this video, we will take a look at these coefficients and

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.553
the output to see how we can interpret each of them.

00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:12.295
So we're going to pay attention to these coefficients here.

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:14.730
And in most cases we don't care about the intercept,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.149
we only care about the ones that are attached to our explanatory variables.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.890
If you need to look at how this was set up, essentially,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.972
we just did what we did in the previous video,

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.559
b ut I did the same thing with the weekday and weekend.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.089
We added the intercept and then we fit a model for all of this.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.589
So in order to interpret these,

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.130
we first need to exponentiate each.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.760
We will exponentiate.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:40.839
Now each of these resulting values is the multiplicative change in the odds.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.250
Specifically, for the weekday dummy variable we would say, on weekdays,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.829
fraud is 12.76 times as likely as on weekends,

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.004
holding all other variables constant.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.325
Which in this case would mean that the duration doesn't change.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:59.455
We can also interpret the coefficient on duration as

00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:02.902
for each one unit increase in the duration on the page,

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:05.875
fraud is 0.23 times as likely,

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:08.644
holding all other variables constant.

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:11.245
When you receive multiplicative changes less than one,

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:13.228
like we did here with the ration,

00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:16.444
it's often useful to compute the reciprocal.

00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:19.000
This changes the direction for the unit increase,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.935
to a unit decrease.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:25.525
So we could say, for every one unit decrease in the duration on the page,

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:28.399
fraud is 4.32 times as likely,

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.159
if all else is held constant.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.140
In this case, that would be whether or not it's a weekday or a weekend.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.599
This flip often helps an audience better relate to the-
