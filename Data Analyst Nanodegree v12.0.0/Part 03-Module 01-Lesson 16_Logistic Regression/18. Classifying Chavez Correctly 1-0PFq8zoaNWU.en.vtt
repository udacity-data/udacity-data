00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.120
Suppose we look at an image of Hugo Chavez.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.290
What's the probability that Hugo will be classified correctly by our

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.130
learning algorithm?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.640
That's going to be a number between zero and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.620
one where one means with absolute certainty and zero means never ever.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.830
You can calculate the probability based on this table over here.
