00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.169
In the last video you saw some output that had

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.309
the following information regarding the coefficients and our logistic regression model.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.350
Similar to in the regression case,

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.500
we might use the p values here to help us understand if

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.879
a particular variable was

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.810
significant in helping us predict if a transaction was fraud or not.

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:21.879
Furthermore, we can interpret

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:26.349
these coefficients but not exactly in the way that you've seen before.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.995
First, we need to exponentiation each of the coefficients.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:33.325
Then, with quantitative variables we would say,

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:36.295
for a one unit increase in your explanatory variable,

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:39.670
we expect a multiplicative change in the odds of

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.810
being in the one category to be the exponential of your coefficient,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.164
holding all other variables constant.

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:48.490
The way you encode dummy variables in

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.960
logistic regression is exactly the same as in multiple linear regression.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.380
So interpreting the dummy variable coefficients is only

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.300
changed again by exponentiating the coefficient.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.309
You can then interpret the exponentiated coefficient

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.420
attached to your dummy variable in a similar way as before.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.075
In this category as compared to the baseline,

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:15.655
we expect a multiplicative change in the odds of being in the one category of this value,

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:18.450
holding all other variables constant.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.000
This might seem confusing now but let's try it out and you'll see that it isn't so bad.
