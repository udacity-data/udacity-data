00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.040
So talk about confusion matrices in different context, you might

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.109
remember the work that Katie showed you on principle component analysis, on PCA.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.800
Were we looked at seven different, I guess white male politicians from

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.100
George Bush to Gerhard Schroeder, and we ran an eigenface analysis.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.585
Extracting the principle components of this data set, and then re-use

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:28.040
the eigenfaces to re-map new faces to names in order to identify people.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.910
So what I'm going to do now, I won't drag you

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.490
through the same PCA example again, so let's do away with those faces.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.410
But instead what I'll do is, I give you a typical output and

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.110
we're going to study the output using confusion matrices.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.750
So Katie was so nice to run a PCA on the faces of those politicians and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
take the resulting features, put it into a support vector machine and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.440
then go through the data and

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.980
count how often any of those people were predicted correctly or misclassified.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.530
And just to confuse everybody, in this example,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.120
we follow the convention of putting the true names, the true class labels,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.180
on the left, and the predicted ones on top.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.990
So, for example, this number one over here was truly Donald Rumsfeld, but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320
was mistaken to be Colin Powell.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.130
And the way I know it's Colin Powell was the same names over here,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.980
from Ariel Sharon to Tony Blair, apply to the columns over here.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.030
Ariel Sharon's on the left and Tony Blair's on the right.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.760
So we ask you a few questions now.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.250
First, a simple one.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.390
Which of those seven politicians was most frequent in our dataset?
