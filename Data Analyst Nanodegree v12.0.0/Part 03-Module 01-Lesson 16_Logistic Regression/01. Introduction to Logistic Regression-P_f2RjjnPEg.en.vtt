00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.710
In the previous lesson,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.634
you saw how we can use multiple linear regression to take

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:12.120
multiple explanatory variables both quantitative and categorical,

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.050
and use them all at the same time to predict a quantitative response variable.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.019
In this lesson, we'll be doing something similar.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.344
However, instead of predicting a quantitative response,

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:25.789
in this lesson we'll be predicting a categorical response.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.049
One of the most popular techniques for doing this is logistic regression,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.545
which you'll learn about in this lesson.

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:38.295
Logistic regression is a regression approach used to predict only two possible outcomes.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:42.270
This can be predicting whether a particular credit card transaction is fraud or not,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.984
whether an individual will click to our website or not,

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.894
whether an individual will default on a loan or not,

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:52.140
or anything else you might like to predict with only two outcomes.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.109
Using linear regression, we were optimizing to

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.200
best predict a continuous numeric variable,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.875
but here we want to correctly predict one of two possible outcomes.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:08.000
We'll start by looking at how this changes the math and setting up our regression model.
