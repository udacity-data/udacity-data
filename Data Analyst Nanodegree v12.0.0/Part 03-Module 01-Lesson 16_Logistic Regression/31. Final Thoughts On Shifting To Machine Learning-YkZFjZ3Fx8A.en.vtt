00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:06.551
If you dive back into the models we face using Scikit-learn,

00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:08.750
you'll notice we didn't get as much information back

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.849
regarding the coefficients in terms of the P-values.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.684
And even if you pulled the coefficients,

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.600
they don't actually match what was retrieved using the stats models library.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.630
The shift from statistics to machine learning is one in which

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.802
we care less about the relation of the inputs to the output,

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:28.914
and one more we care about predicting the output correctly regardless of the input.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:33.147
The Scikit-learn Library is one of the most popular machine learning libraries.

00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:37.295
And therefore, the tools in this library are just aimed at the second point.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:41.210
The last content on model diagnostics using cross validation and

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.335
Scikit-learn is beyond the regular work done and most data analyst roles.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.020
However, it might pique your interest as to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.460
the beginning of our career related to machine learning and data science.
