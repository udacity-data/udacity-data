Congratulations on finishing this lesson on logistic regression.

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:08.859
We've covered a ton of information,

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.910
from when to use logistic regression,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.000
to how do you know if your model's predicting well,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.129
to how do you interpret the coefficients.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.929
I hope you've enjoyed learning with me,

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.000
as much as I've enjoyed teaching you.
