00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.950
And the answer is 0.625.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.910
And the way I got this,I look at the cases where we have Hugo Chavez.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.260
There's a total of 16.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.530
Three plus two plus one plus ten.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410
And of those 16 cases,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.750
the number of ones that are classified correctly are only 10.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.404
So 10 over 16 is 0.625
