00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.310
I say the false alarm is one where your alarm goes off, so positive for

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.939
burglary, but there isn't a burglary.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:11.090
So in the true world the event is negative, but your system says positive.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.490
So this is where the check mark should go and you can see a bit of an asymmetry.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.230
You can see that you might care about negative events that give you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.000
a positive alarm differently from positive events that are being missed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.900
And just to give you kind of a little bit of look ahead,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.250
often by changing parameters you can move this curve in either direction.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.320
And if you believe that a false alarm, which is the police come to

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.090
your house checking for burglary, is a different price point from a missed event

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.800
like someone robbing you of all your belongings without police even noticing,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.800
then you might want to reshift this line up and down.
