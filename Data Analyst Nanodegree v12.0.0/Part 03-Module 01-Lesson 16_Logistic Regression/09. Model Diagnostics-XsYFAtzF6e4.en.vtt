00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.700
When determining how well your logistic regression model

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.980
is doing at predicting the correct labels,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.144
the most common measure to use is called, accuracy.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.439
Accuracy is the proportion of

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.265
correctly labeled rows divided by the total number of rows in the data set.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:21.390
There are some cases where accuracy won't work well,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.585
particularly when you have large class imbalances in your data set.

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:29.670
With that in mind, Sebastian will be going through some of the other metrics that are

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.980
commonly used and how to understand

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.829
whether your model is performing well with these metrics.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.000
Some of the references made in these videos are not true for this class as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.289
this information is part of

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.435
the full free machine learning course linked in the instructor notes below.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.530
Once Sebastian has shown you these metrics,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.009
we'll be working together to implement them in Python.
