00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Fitting logistic regression models is

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:05.140
actually very similar to what you were doing in the last lesson,

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:07.094
fitting linear regression models.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:11.734
We can again use stats models to perform logistic regression on our dataset.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:15.855
First, let's load our necessary libraries and the data as you see here.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.414
Similar to linear regression,

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:18.989
any variables that are categorical,

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.164
we will want to change dummy variables.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:24.125
So, in this dataset that will be the day,

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:25.980
which you can see is labeled as weekend,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.565
or weekday, and fraud which is either false or true.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:32.414
So, we want to change those both the dummy variables,

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:36.420
and then we could fill in missing values and things like that.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.780
Although, I don't think there are any in this dataset.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.240
As you can see there is no missing values here,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.285
and so we should create our dummy variables.

00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:53.549
And for now I'm just going to dummy the fraud variable,

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.269
and we'll use duration to predict fraud,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.415
and we will also add an intercept.

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.174
So, here you can see we created those dummy variables,

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:08.099
and I just created it with a zero for false up here,

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.909
and then a one if it is true in this column.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.950
And so I actually don't need that last one, we could drop it.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.085
And, so that will be my data frame and let's go ahead and use stats models now.

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:25.659
And for logistic regression,

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.109
instead of using the OLS,

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.200
we're going to use what's called the Logit.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.019
And the first argument that we need to pass is the response,

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:36.920
so we are going to pass.

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:45.320
So, I am just going to pass this fraud and we should create our intercept.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.179
So then similar to what you did in the last lesson,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.520
we will pass the intercept.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.823
I do not know why my color highlighting is not working anymore.

00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:57.045
And let's say we want to use duration,

00:01:57.045 --> 00:01:59.335
so we can create our model that way.

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:06.349
And then again we can get a summary.

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.944
We need to fit it and then store that, cool.

00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:14.139
So, did the optimization and you can see we

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.000
get similar output to what you saw in the previous lesson.
