00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.160
You might not have noticed but in the previous lesson on

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.570
linear regression your predicted response variable was not constrained at all.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.760
That means, that with the right inputs it was possible to predict the house that

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.464
has a negative price or that the height of an individual is 80 feet.

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:22.765
Using logistic regression as opposed to linear regression,

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.335
bounds our response to a probability between zero and one,

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:29.964
rather than any possible value like you saw with linear regression.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:32.835
Mathematically, to perform logistic regression,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.350
we need to change the labels of fraud or not,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.730
success or failure and the other variables to only a one and zero outcome.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.789
So, in the credit card transaction example,

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.039
you could call all the fraud cases one,

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.174
while all the non-fraud cases would be zero values.

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:51.584
Then, logistic regression is set up in a way where

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:56.505
our linear model will predict the log odds instead of predicting the response itself.

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.950
Here, P is the probability of a one value occurring.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.800
So, this is a ratio of a probability of an event

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.579
occurring as compared to the probability of the event not occurring.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.549
This is called the odds ratio and by taking

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.759
the log and equating this to our linear regression line,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.484
we control our predictions to be between zero and one for the probability of a success.

00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:19.090
With a bit of algebra,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.000
you can change the equation using the log odds to look

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.719
like this and this solves for probability directly.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.965
This function here is called the sigmoid.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:30.640
The sigmoid function takes the value from

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.560
your linear regression line and maps it between zero and one as a probability.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.689
Both of these equations are commonly

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.799
used to understand the setup for logistic regression.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.250
Let us get some practice with this.
