And this data point is truly positive.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.230
It's a red cross, but it's predicted to be negative.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.290
So truly actual positive was predicted negative falls over

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.930
here and not over there.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.770
I hope you got that right.
