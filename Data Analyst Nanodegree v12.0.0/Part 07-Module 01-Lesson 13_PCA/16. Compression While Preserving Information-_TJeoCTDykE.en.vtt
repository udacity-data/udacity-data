00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:03.250
And SelectkBest is probably going to be the right answer here,

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.600
because you know exactly how many you're expecting to get out.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.039
You're expecting to get exactly two, so

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.940
it will throw away all the features except the two that are the most powerful.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.448
Select Percentile isn't a great choice for this scenario,

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:17.570
because you don't already know exactly how many features you have.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.160
Although in the case that we gave in the warm up example,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.290
where you have exactly four features and you know you want two, you could

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.760
also just run Select Percentile with 50%, and that will give you two features.
