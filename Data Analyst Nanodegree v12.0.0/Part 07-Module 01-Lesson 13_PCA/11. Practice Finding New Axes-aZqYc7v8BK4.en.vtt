00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.710
And, I would argue delta x is 2, so if we go down with, here in this axis,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.470
one down in the y direction, then we go two to the right.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.580
And, kind of orthogonally, as we go one to the right here, we go two up.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.400
So, the delta y over here is also 2.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.640
It turns out these two vectors again are orthogonal.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.270
If you understand what a dot product is and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.980
you did the dot product of these two vectors you will get zero which is a measure of orthogonality.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.930
But that's not really that important.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.380
What's important is that we found out where the center of the data is and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.230
we found the principle axis of variation.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.620
The only last thing I didn't tell you about, the only last thing is that PCA

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.920
also returns an importance value, a spread value for this axis.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.380
An that spread value tends to be very large for the very first axis of variation

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.050
and much smaller for the second axis of variation if the spread is small.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.140
So this number is, happens to be an, an eigenvalue.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.120
It comes out of an eigenvalue decomposition that's really implemented by PCA.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.890
But what it really gives you is an importance vector,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.940
how important to take each axis when you look at the data.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.930
So when you run the code you'll find the new origin,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.090
you find these different vectors and you'll find an importance value is given to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.490
these vectors that really measures the amount of spread.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.580
So let me do a little quiz here to see if we are at odds with each other.
