00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.080
So here's a quick quiz just to make sure that you got it.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.100
Suppose this red line is the principal component.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.109
It's our new neighborhood quality feature.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.120
Of course, that's kind of a meaning that we ascribe to it.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.750
mathematically, it's just defined as the definition of maximum variance.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.620
And the question is,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.940
once we project down all our data points onto this principal component,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.660
what is the data distribution that we get for our new feature?

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.160
So, click the box that looks right to you.
