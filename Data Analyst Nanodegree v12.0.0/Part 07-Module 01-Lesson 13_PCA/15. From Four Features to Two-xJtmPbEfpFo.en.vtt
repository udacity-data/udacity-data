00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:02.540
And I would say that the square footage of a home and

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.090
the number of rooms are both ways of measuring how big the house is.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.200
Of course the square footage is probably going to be a fairly direct measurement

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.880
of this, but things like how many bedrooms there are,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.670
what the floor plan is, potentially also other things like the number of

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.060
windows can affect how big the house feels from the inside.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.280
So that's why size can be a little bit subjective and

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.140
not something that you can probe directly with a single number.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.360
School ranking and neighborhood safety, on the other hand,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.240
I would say, are measurable variables that are associated with the quality of

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.330
the neighborhood overall.
