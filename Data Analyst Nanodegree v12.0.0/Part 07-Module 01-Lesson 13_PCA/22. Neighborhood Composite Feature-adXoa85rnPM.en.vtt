00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.624
And I hope you said this first one.

00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:04.543
That's roughly what I would expect if we
were to project all of these points down

00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:06.420
and start making xs all along the line like this.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.300
There doesn't seem to be
any particularly tight or

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.365
distinct clusters in this data,
that PCA would accentuate.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.162
And the data is also not
particularly spaced out evenly.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.580
So that gives you this first
answer as the correct one.
