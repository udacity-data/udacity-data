00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.320
This whole discussion has been a little abstract.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.420
So now I want to show you one of my favorite uses of PCA in the wild.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.470
And that's facial recognition.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.125
So first let's think about what makes facial recognition in pictures a,

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.210
a good application of PCA.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.480
Why is this problem and the solution well suited for each other.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.070
Here are some options and the answer could be one or more of the following.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.810
The first option is that pictures of faces generally have

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.470
a high input dimensionality.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.010
In other words if there's many pixels in a picture of a face.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.710
And that potentially any of those pixels could be important for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.640
figuring out who that person is.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.650
The second possibility is that faces have general patterns that could be

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.940
captured in a smaller number of dimensions.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.380
So there's always the general pattern that someone has two eyes that are sort of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.080
near the top of their face.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.810
There's a, a mouth and then a chin that's on the bottom, and etcetera.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.160
And the third possibility is that facial recognition is simple,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.510
once you use machine learning.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.830
That since humans can do it so easily, a computer can do it easily too.
