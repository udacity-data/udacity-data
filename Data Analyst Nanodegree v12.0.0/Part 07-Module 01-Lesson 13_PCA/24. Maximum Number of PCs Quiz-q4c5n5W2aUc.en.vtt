00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.670
Here's a concrete follow-up example.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.222
Suppose you have a data set that has a 100 training points, and

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:07.590
4 features for each point.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.860
What's the maximum number of principal components that are going to be allowed

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.300
by sklearn, and that you could find using any other implementation of PCA?
