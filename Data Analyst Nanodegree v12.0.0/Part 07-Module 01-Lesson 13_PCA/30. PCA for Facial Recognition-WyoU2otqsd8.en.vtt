00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.150
I would argue that the first two answers are the ones that are more accurate.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.520
Picture of faces certainly do have many pixels.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.645
A one megapixel camera will have a million input features if

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:10.780
you're using it in the raw input space.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.395
So this is really prime to get some reduction somehow.

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:18.340
because a million features would be really difficult for, say, an SVM to handle.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.330
The second thing that's true is that there are some underlying patterns in

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.700
faces that is really well suited for PCA.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.540
So since we think that there are just a few underlying latent variables, so

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.900
in the example of a one megapixel image,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.770
I wouldn't say that there's a million points of difference between two faces.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190
That there will just be a few general points of difference and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
that maybe PCA can, can tease those out and use them to their maximum ability.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.190
And the third thing that I wouldn't say is true is that facial recognition is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.010
simple using machine learning.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.181
For example, a decision tree will have a lot of difficulty trying to do

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:53.220
facial recognition.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.322
As we'll see in the following code example using PCA and, say,

00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:00.230
an SVM together, you can get a lot of power.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.070
But in general, even though it's something that humans do quite easily.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.060
We have brains that are particularly well optimized for recognizing each other.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.110
It's an evolutionary advantage.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
And computers a priori don't necessarily have that ability.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.050
So doing facial recognition with machine learning,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.590
while it's a well understood problem at this point, is something that is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.340
maybe a little bit trickier than you would naively first guess.
