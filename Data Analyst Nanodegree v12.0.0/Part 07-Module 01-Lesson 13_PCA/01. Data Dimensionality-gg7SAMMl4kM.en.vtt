00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.070
Okay, Katie asked me to introduce to you Principle Component Analysis,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.900
often called PCA.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.990
PCA is one of these things that's been used thoroughly in all kinds of

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.860
data analysis including feature set compression.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.770
And it's really good to get a basic understanding of what it is so

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.610
you can use it every time you want to visualize data.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.200
Let me start with an example quiz.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.240
You have a two dimensional data space.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.210
And here's your data.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.250
And for the time being,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.270
I'm just going to use the single class, we can change this later.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.499
Question asks you, sounds trivial, but

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.970
I want to know what is the dimensionality of the data.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.660
And just give you two choices, either one dimensional or two dimensional.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.230
If you look at that data what would you think?
