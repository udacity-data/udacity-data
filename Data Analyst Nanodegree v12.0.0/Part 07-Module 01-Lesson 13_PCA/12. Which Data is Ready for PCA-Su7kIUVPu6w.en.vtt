00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.650
And the answer is yes in all cases.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.130
Now the clear cut case is the left one, which is the one we already discussed.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.690
But we have data on a circle that could still be a main axis and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.090
a secondary axis.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.300
And PCA will actually give you a deterministic result, typically the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.210
first X in this direction, second this direction.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.540
The third one is surprising.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.940
When we, remember regression,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.480
it's impossible to build a regression that goes vertically because you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.710
can't really divide this data set here as a function y equals f of x.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.690
But regression treats the variables very asymmetrically.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.740
One is the input, one is the output.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.170
In PCA, all we get is vectors.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.420
So I can easily imagine a coordinate system where the x axis falls vertically,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.480
and the y axis goes to the left, and that's the answer for PCA in this case.
