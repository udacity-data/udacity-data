The correct answer is going to be this last one.

00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:04.858
This is what the new one-dimensional feature is going to look like after I've

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:06.020
done the projection.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.880
In other words, if I took this box and I removed all the blue circles and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.880
all the green lines, and I just had sort of the red line here with the,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.550
with the black x's on it, the new feature, it would look like this last option.
