00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.670
And there was a challenging question.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.850
In this case, I would say yes.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.200
Once you have the spread captured in this direction,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.460
there isn't much left in the orthonormal direction.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.572
The dominance is also here clear where the major axis really captures all of it

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:14.396
and there's really nothing left in the minor axis.

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:17.420
But over here is not so clear so even if you draw the major axis to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.210
be over here, the minor axis is still as spread as the major axis.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.000
In fact, in this case, I would assume that both Eiger values are of

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.260
the same magnitude and we really haven't gained much by running PCA.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.620
So it's a clear no over here.
