00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.500
So my answer in this case is one dimensional, and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.190
you might disagree, but, in principle,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.100
the data really falls onto this line over here which is one dimensional line.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.660
We can make a new coordinate system, x prime and y prime.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.040
And the truth is, it's not exactly one dimension,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.760
there's sort of little deviations here and there.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
But for the sake of understanding the data, I'm happy to treat those

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.620
deviations as noise and think of this as a one-dimensional data set.
