00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.430
The next question is even more interesting.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.210
The x prime axis is a vector.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.440
In the old coordinate system, obviously starts at (2, 3).

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.600
And, this one, it has the vector component of this axis over here,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.790
in the old coordinate system.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.700
So, we call this delta x and delta y for the x prime axis.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.620
And, I wanna know, if I set delta x to one, so we go one step to the right.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.470
What do you think the delta y is to define this axis over here?

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.930
So, give me that number, please
