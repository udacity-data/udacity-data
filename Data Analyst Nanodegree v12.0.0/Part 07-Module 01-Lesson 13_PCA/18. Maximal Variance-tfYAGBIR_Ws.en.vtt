00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.060
So that example that we just did was an example of combining the number of

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.530
rooms and the square footage into a size feature.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.950
And I asked you to just take it on faith for

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.480
a moment that the principle component existed and it was where I said it was.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.560
Now I'm going to use the neighborhood example to show you how to

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.410
determine the principle component.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.450
First I want to start with a little bit of vocab.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.430
And the word is variance, which is a little bit confusing because you

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.660
actually already know a definition of variance.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.890
It's a very important definition.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.650
It's the willingness or flexibility of an algorithm to learn.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.880
But we're going to mean it in a different sense.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.610
Variance is also a technical term in statistics,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.095
which means roughly the spread of a data distribution.

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:38.090
It's something that's very similar to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.860
the standard deviation if that's something that you're familiar with.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.270
So a feature that has a large variance has instances that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.860
fall over a very large numerical range of values that it can take.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.170
Whereas something with a small variance means that the features tend to be

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.650
more clustered together tightly.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.070
So here's an example using a as yet unlabeled data set.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920
So suppose this is my data.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.100
Then what I can do is draw an oval around it that roughly contains most of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.790
the data.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.379
Maybe 95% of the data are within this oval.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.300
Now this oval could be parametrized using two numbers.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.930
One of them is the distance across the narrowest point.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.590
The other one is the distance across the longest point.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.450
Now here's the critical question.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.720
Which of these two lines points along the direction of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.060
the maximum variance of the data?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.370
In other words, in which direction is the data more spread out?

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.059
Check the box that you think has the right answer.
