00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.650
In all these data cases, I kind of make them up to make my point here, but

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.260
they could look like this.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.970
For the new coordinate system, there's an x and

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.461
y, and again, maybe we truncate to the nearest 0.5.

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:16.660
And then the x prime axis has delta x and delta y,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.850
and so does the y prime axis of the new coordinate system.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.110
I'm filling in some values to resolve ambiguities.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.080
Let's give it a try first with x and y.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.790
What's the new center here?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.860
Give me those two numbers.
