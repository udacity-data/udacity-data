00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.660
Now, it's a little bit beyond the scope of the class for

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.300
me to actually show you how to find the direction of maximal variance.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.140
It involves some linear algebra which isn't too difficult, but

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.400
we're not going to get into here.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.870
But if you're willing to believe me that the principle component,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.290
the direction of maximal variance can be found.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.000
I can justify to you that,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.170
that's the direction that's going to minimize the information loss.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.360
Now let's look at the neighborhood information for our housing data.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.670
This is my data that I have available to me.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.910
On one axis I have a number of safety problems in a given neighborhood.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.390
On the other axis I have the school ranking of that neighborhood.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.910
And I'm going to use PCA to combine these two features into a single

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.840
feature that I'll say is roughly gauging the quality of the neighborhood.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.550
So just by visually inspecting the data we can see something like

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.380
this red line is going to be the principal component.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.155
Then when I project down the two-dimensional points onto this

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.080
one-dimensional line I'm going to be losing information.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.780
And the amount of information that I lose is equal to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.360
the distance between a given point, as it existed in this sort of 2D space, and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.970
its new spot on the line.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.770
So, for this blue point here, an amount of information thatâ€™s roughly equal to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.390
the, the length of this yellow line, is the amount of information that I lose.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.700
So, here's a little quiz to make sure you understand.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.870
I'm circling a point in green here.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.760
And this point is going to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.360
be projected down onto the principal component as well.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.730
Like all the other points in this dataset, eventually.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.440
So my question for you is, how much information are we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.610
going to be losing when we perform that projection at this point?

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.910
Is it going to be more, less, or about equal to the amount of information that's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.010
lost on our original point, this example that I just showed you?
