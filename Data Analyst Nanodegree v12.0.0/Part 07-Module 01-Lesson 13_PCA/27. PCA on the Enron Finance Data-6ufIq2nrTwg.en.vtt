00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.510
And, the correct answer is something like this line over here.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.390
I'm not entirely sure it's the correct line,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.340
but there's a correlation between x and y.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.880
And, you can see,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.930
the more you go to the right side, the more these, these numbers increase.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.200
And, that gives me,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
as the main axis of variation, kind of the spectrum over here
