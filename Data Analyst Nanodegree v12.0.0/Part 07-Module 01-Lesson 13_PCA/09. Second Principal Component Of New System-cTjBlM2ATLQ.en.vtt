00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.700
I can do the same for the other orthogonal vector over here.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.740
Delta x and delta y in red, it defines the y prime axis.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.820
So just like before, give me your best guesses for delta x and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.630
delta y, it's not an ambiguous question.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.110
But I want to be as simple as over here, describing the vector to the left.
