00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.680
So now through all these misleading quizzes that I gave you,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.510
you now are in the perfect position to understand principal component analysis.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.200
And I will explain to you in 20 seconds, and it's going to stick for

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.730
the rest of your life.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.070
If your given data of any shape whatsoever,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.960
like this data point cloud over here, PCA finds a new coordinate system that's

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.820
obtained from the old one by translation and rotation only.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.200
And it moves the center of the coordinate system with the center of the data,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
right over here.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.200
It moves the x-axis into the principal axis of variation, where you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.600
see the most variation relative to all the data points, and it moves further

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.880
axis down the road into a orthogonal less important directions of variation.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.750
So look at the original data here.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.654
I would argue that the data really lies mostly on this line over here.

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:55.800
And then secondly on your orthogonal line over here, and principal component analysis finds

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.120
for you these axes and also tells you how important these axes are.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.220
So let's exercise this.
