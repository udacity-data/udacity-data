00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240
And I hope you said that this sounds like a regression question.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.370
This is a classic type of regression exercise because the output that we

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.560
expect to get is going to be continuous.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.310
So it's not appropriate to use a classifier.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.140
We want to use something like a regression that can give us

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.120
a number as an output, where this number's the price of the house.
