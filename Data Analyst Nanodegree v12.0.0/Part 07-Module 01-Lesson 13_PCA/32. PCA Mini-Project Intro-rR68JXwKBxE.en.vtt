00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.730
I don't know about you but I think the eigenfaces example for PCA is really,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.320
really cool, and I like it enough that I'm going to have it be the basis

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.880
of the coding exercises you'll be doing in this mini-project for the PCA lesson.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.320
So what I'll do is give you the eigenfaces code, and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.860
point you towards some of the places that I want you to play around with,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.620
say the number of principle components that are being used.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.730
Or to figure out what the eigean values are for

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.270
the various principle components.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.140
So, at the end of this mini lesson, you're really familiar with the PCA code.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.880
And you can go in really quickly and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.150
identify where all the important moving pieces are.
