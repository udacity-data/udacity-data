00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.740
So now that you have a glimpse about what PCA does, let's do PCA by hand,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.370
and I'm going to kind of make up

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.560
an example here that hopefully makes sense to you once you do it.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.874
So we've kind of made data that lies between the coordinates 1,2,

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:20.570
somewhere uniform and 3,4 along this line of elongation.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.750
So we know that PCA finds a coordinate system that centers itself in the data

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.100
and aligns the x axis with the principal axis of variation.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.460
Where do you think, relative to the old coordinate system x and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.710
y, is the center of origin for this new coordinate system?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.390
Please truncate to the closest integer.
