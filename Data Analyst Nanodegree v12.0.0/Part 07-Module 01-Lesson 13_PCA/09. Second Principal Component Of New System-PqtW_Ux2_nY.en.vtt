00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:02.170
And let's say, I mean, there's many different solutions, but

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.540
I'd say the best answer is, minus 1 for

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.340
the x because we go left and still plus 1 for y.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.860
These are two what's called orthogonal vectors.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.470
Those define the two principle directions here.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.650
In reality, when we write vectors in PCA,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.320
what you find is lowest output vectors is normalized to one.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.820
This one here has a length of square root of 2.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.884
So when you, when you rescale those vectors,

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:30.140
you find that square root of 2 over here minus square root of 2.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.791
And square of 2 vectors of that length have a total length of 1,

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:40.407
because the total length is given by the square root of the squares of the sum.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:46.512
Being as it is; the principal vectors found by PCA are the one over here,

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:48.426
and the one over here.

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:49.400
So let's do this again.
