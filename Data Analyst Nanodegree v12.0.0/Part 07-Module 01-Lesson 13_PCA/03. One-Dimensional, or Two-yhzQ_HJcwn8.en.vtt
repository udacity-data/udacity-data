00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.890
And I would argue it's clearly one dimensional,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.380
except the dimension right now doesn't really align very well with the axes.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.630
But if I remap the data into a new space, say we call this axis x prime and

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.830
this axis y prime, by simple rotation of the original coordinate system and

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.190
possibly a shift you can see that now in this new coordinate system.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.460
The data is easily mapped onto one of the two variables over here.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.070
I call this one-dimensional.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.450
If you got this wrong, no big deal because you didn't quite know what I what I

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.440
meant by one-dimensional, but now we know.
