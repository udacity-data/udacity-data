The green data point is going to be the one that's going to have a greater

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.200
information loss, because the distance from the green point to the red line,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.870
is greater than the distance from, the yellow point to the red line.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.960
And, the amount of information that's lost is proportional to that distance
