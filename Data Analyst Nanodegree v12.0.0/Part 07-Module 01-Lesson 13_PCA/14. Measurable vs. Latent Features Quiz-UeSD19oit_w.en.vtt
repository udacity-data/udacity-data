00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.670
Here's a simple example that will help you develop some intuition for

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.010
what you're doing when you use PCA.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.930
Suppose I have the following question, given the features of a house,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.460
what is the price that I would expect for it to sell for?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.900
Which of the following algorithms would you use to answer this question?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.630
Would you use a decision tree classifier, an SVC or a support vector classifier,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.860
or does this sound like a linear regression question to you?
