00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.700
This is sort of a tricky question, so if you, if you guessed, I don't blame you.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.110
The correct answer is number two, that what you want to do is be

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.830
open to different number of principal components being relevant to you.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.550
And the way that you figure out, sort of,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.110
what that trend is, is just by trying different numbers.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.450
You say, just give me the first principal component, the first plus the second,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.720
the first plus the second plus the third, and you watch how the accuracy

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.520
responds to these increasing numbers of principal components.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.240
You can also do this in just plain old feature selection as well.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.090
You say, give me all the features in the order of their importance, and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.800
I'm just going to try adding them one at a time and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.010
see how the accuracy responds, and cut off when it seems like it's plateauing.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.851
One thing you don't want to do though is performing feature selection before you

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:42.489
go into PCA.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.562
So remember PCA is going to find a way to combine information from

00:00:46.562 --> 00:00:50.610
potentially many different input features together.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.190
So if you're throwing out input features before you do PCA, you're throwing our

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.510
that information that, that PCA might be able to kind of rescue in a sense.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.680
It's fine to do feature selection on the principal components after you've made

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.780
them, but you want to be very careful about throwing out information before you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.910
perform PCA.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.000
That having been said, PCA can be fairly computationally expensive.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.370
So if you have a very large input feature space and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.380
you know that a lot of them are potentially completely irrelevant features,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.050
go ahead and try tossing them out, but proceed with caution.
