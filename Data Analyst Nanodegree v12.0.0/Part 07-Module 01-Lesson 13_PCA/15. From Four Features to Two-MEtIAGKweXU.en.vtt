00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.000
When you're making your regression to determine the price of a house,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.880
there's going to be a number of input features that you might potentially be

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.790
interested in.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.570
Things like the square footage, the number of rooms in the house, and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.150
also things about maybe the neighborhood or the location,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.090
things like how well are the schools ranked, and how safe is the neighborhood.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.490
And these are all things that you can measure fairly directly.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.160
You can go look up the school ranking on the Internet.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.180
You can measure the square footage with a, with a measuring tape.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.320
But I would argue that when you're making these measurements,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.030
you're really just probing two things even though I have four features here.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.134
You're probing the size of the home and

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:34.150
you're asking questions about the neighborhood.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.610
And these are two examples of latent variables.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.910
These are variables that you can't measure directly, but

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.200
that are sort of driving the phenomenon that you're measuring behind the scenes.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.700
So, here's a question.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.350
Suppose that the latent variable that I'm trying to probe is the size of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.920
the home that I'm interested in.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.890
Place a check next to any of these features that you think are basically

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.330
measurements that are probing the size of the home.
