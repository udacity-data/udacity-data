00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.752
So now you know what determines the principle component of a dataset.

00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:06.130
It's the direction that has the largest variance in the data.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.180
So, in our example, that would be this heavy red line here.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.360
You can see how this is very different from a regression,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.210
although I know it's sometimes looks like the same thing.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.430
But here what you're trying to do is you're trying to find the direction of

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.480
maximal variance, not to make a prediction.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.010
So, here's a question for you.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.680
This is a tough one, so give it some thought and then tell me what you think.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.400
Why do you think we define the principal component this way?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.530
What's the advantage of looking for the direction that has the largest variance?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.090
In other words, when we're doing our projection of these,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.610
this two dimensional feature space down on to one dimension, why do we project

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.290
all the data points down onto this heavy red line instead of projecting them

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.120
onto this shorter line, just as an example of a different way that it could be?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.820
Do we want to use this direction because it's the computationally easiest

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.850
direction to find?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.100
Do you think that it's the best because it will retain the maximum amount of

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.000
information from the original data,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.800
that when we do this two-dimensional compression down to one dimension that we

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.470
keep as much information as possible with this formulation?

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.870
Or do you think that it's just a convention and maybe there's no real reason.
