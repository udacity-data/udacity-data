00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.900
So here are three scenarios, one where the data lies on a line like this,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.157
one where the data literally comes from a circle like that in a kind of very

00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:13.960
equal distribution in the X and Y axis, and one where the data falls vertical.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.400
And they're going to ask a couple of true or false questions here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.750
First one, does the principal component analysis return a result?

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.500
Yes or no for either of these cases.
