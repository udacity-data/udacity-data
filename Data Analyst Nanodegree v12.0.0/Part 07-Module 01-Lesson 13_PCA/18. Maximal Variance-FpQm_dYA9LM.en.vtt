00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.500
And this longer line is going to be the direction of maximum variance.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.830
You can tell just by looking at the length of the line here.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.070
The long line is going to be longer than the short line.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.980
So that's going to be the direction of maximum variance.
