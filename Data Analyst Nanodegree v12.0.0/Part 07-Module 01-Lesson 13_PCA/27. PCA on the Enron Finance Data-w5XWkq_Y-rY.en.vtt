00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.428
Katie has pulled together, from our favorite data set,

00:00:02.428 --> 00:00:04.125
information about people's compensation.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:06.610
So each dot in here is a person.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.714
And horizontally graphed is an annual bonus, so this person on the right,

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:14.770
in this year made $8 million, that's 0.8 times 10 to the 7.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.900
And over here is a long term bonus that goes all the way to $4 million.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.450
And you can see that there's roughly a bit of a correlation between how much

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.580
money people made in the annual performance bonus in their long term bonuses.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.790
We are less concerned about whether this was ethical and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.760
much more concerned about running principal component analysis on this data.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.498
so, to do this let me test your intuition first.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:46.149
I'm going to give you for the primary principle component three guesses,

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.534
a black guess, a red guess, and a green guess.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:52.755
And, from what you've learned so far, which one do you think is

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:55.677
going to be the main principal component along which the,

00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:57.610
the vast amount of [INAUDIBLE] occurs.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.110
Pick one.
