00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.510
The correct answer is that we do it this way because when we project along

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.470
the dimension of the largest variance this retains the maximum amount of

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.640
information in the original data.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.950
So, if we have to do a compression we want to choose a compression algorithm so

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.770
to speak that retains the maximum amount of information from the original data.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.900
And, as it turns out,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.260
that means projecting it onto the direction of the largest variance
