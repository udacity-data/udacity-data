00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.140
I'm going to let you explore that code we just looked at on your own

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.340
during the project portion of this lesson.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.990
There's just one more thing I want to cover though before I set you

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.870
loose on that.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.550
And that is how to think about selecting how many principal components you

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.440
should look at.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.760
In that last example,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.900
they went from 1850 features on the input to 150 principal components.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.040
And the question you might be wondering is,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.640
how did they come up with that number?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.400
It's a little bit tough to answer that, because there's no cut and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.190
dry answer for how many principal components you should use.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.810
You kind of have to figure it out.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.550
Which of these options do you think sounds like a good way to figure out how

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.890
many principal components you should be using?

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.970
Here are your options.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.300
The first one is, just always take the top 10%, as a rule of thumb.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.730
A second option is that you can train on a different number of

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.320
principal components, and then see how the accuracy response for

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.420
each of those possible numbers of principal components.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.580
And then, once you do this several times, it will become clear that there

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.090
is a point of diminishing returns where as you add more principal components,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.690
you don't get much more in terms of discrimination.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.320
And that you should cut off once you start to plateau.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.209
And the third option is that you could perform feature selection on the input

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.500
features before you put them into PCA, and then you just use as many principal

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.560
components as you had from input features after you've performed that selection.
