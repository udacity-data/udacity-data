00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.100
And you might disagree.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.950
For the sake of principle component analysis actually it turns out to be

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.510
two dimensional.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.330
Even though there's clearly a one dimensional structure underneath this

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.930
data that you could draw.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.135
It seems pretty clear that whatever you have to do to the coordinate system

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:20.640
twists it in some sort of a non-linear way.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.040
And PCA in particular specializes on just shifts and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.090
rotation for the coordinate system.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.860
And you can't possibly come up with a coordinate system that is just shifted and

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.590
only rotated from the original one to obtain one-dimensionality.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
So, as a result, two is the answer I wanted and it was a trick question.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.170
It was certainly a little unfair.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.820
Because the best you can possibly do is put a coordinate system like this and

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.090
like this, where there's still significant variation in the y-dimension,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.270
in the data points.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.029
Way too much for my taste to call it one-dimensional.
