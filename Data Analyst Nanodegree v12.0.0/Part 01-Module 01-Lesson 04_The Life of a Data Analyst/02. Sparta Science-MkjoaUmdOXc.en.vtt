00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
There's a sincere desire

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.860
to compete and be part of a team and injuries sidetrack a lot of those intentions.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.530
My name is Phil Wagner and I'm the CEO and founder of Sparta Science.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.610
Our goal is to provide a solution for any individual that's looking to be

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.840
active and really reducing and preventing the injuries that tend to occur.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.455
When I started to notice these trends behind injuries,

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:37.730
I guess I wasn't thinking about data first because I think like most good practitioners,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.525
I was thinking about the individual first and how to avoid

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:46.970
the frustration and the emotional pain of enduring a setback, like an injury.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.745
One of the defining characteristics of that is the data that that individual produces.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:56.545
The force play analysis looks at ground reaction force.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:59.495
So, when you're jumping and you put force down,

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.320
it causes you to go up.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250
So, more force into the ground allows you to jump

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.390
higher and those patterns are what we call movement signature.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.520
That movement signature has been linked to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.795
different injury risks and different performance capabilities.

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:17.640
The value of good data and really longitudinal data is,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.545
you can start to identify trends.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.180
You can start to become predictive of which exercises and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.340
training programs are going to be most

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.955
effective at reducing or rehabilitating that injury.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:31.185
So, we work with Stanford University,

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:34.910
University of Pacific, Brigham Young University amongst several others.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.440
So, what makes us different is,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.865
we've been able to reduce insurance premiums for universities to

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:47.065
save professional teams money by having less days lost due to injury.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.725
So, really having those kinds of results and that kind of impact,

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:52.850
that is what makes Sparta unique.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.910
At the end of the day, the value we're providing is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.230
not coming from having a force played,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.780
it's really from the datasets.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.270
So, we want to invest in the framework for software engineers to build

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.789
that and from data scientists to continue to make meaning out of those datasets.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.014
But, really for me,

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:16.390
it all began thinking about how do we address and help each individual person.
