00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.200
I don't know if I'd call myself a data scientist,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.495
but actually I work a lot with data scientist and also build tools for data scientists.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:12.315
I work in the Watson Data and AI group.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.940
I'd been at this lab since 2001,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.680
and been working in the field of data management, databases,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.710
and unstructured data with content management and now with AI.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.350
As a field of analytics has evolved and then the area of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.010
data science is obviously becoming way more

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.260
important and prominent and all the skills to go with it.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.480
IBM the type of skills that we look for, obviously,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.560
having a lot of data science skills and analytical skills.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.200
People that also have an understanding of some of the business,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.150
and maybe some of the industries,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.895
is also very helpful.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:52.300
So they can work with business analysts and product managers.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.280
The other part is not just a data science skills,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.360
but it has some programming skills that help integrate into an application,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.879
and even understanding the architectures of artificial intelligence and data science,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.285
and how the whole data and models all flow together.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:14.240
So people that have combinations of those skills are really valuable.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.410
I think that's really a key part of this whole thing,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.520
having somebody that's both knows the science,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.910
but also is curious and wants to apply it,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.155
and is willing to learn the contexts of the original problem.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.600
So I'm really excited that these online courses,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.999
people can get educated,

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.070
and you really educate people that have been in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.325
traditional fields to re-learn these new skills,

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:44.130
because these are the skills that we need now.
