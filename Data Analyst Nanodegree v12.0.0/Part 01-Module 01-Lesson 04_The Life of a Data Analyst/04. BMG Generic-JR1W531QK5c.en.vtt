00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:03.240
So, I'm really interested.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.585
It's what I call bridging the gap between the poets and the quants,

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:12.150
and the idea is to make numbers tell a story and speak to people who are not necessarily

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.570
accustomed to working with data to make

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.844
it into a story that they can digest understand and then act upon.

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:23.129
So, I started out as a literary agent and studied

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.799
English literature and I realized that I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.920
was actually interested in transitioning to the business side of media.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.680
So, during my MBA,

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.579
I focused on statistics and big data electives wherever I could and I also

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.545
pursued my own online learning to learn the coding bits and the technical bit.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:44.130
Just after the MBA joined the Bertlesmann group in the Bertlesmann entrepreneurs program.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.550
In terms of the music industry at large,

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.819
the main applications of data science are around streaming.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.460
So, how do people discover music,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.285
how are they consuming music especially being able to track

00:00:56.284 --> 00:01:01.654
the path from discovery to becoming a fan on streaming services.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:08.040
Finding new acts, how can you automate some of that search especially given the explosion

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.910
of just the amount of content that is out

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.954
there also just around being able to forecast and predict.

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:19.495
Sales, how much stock you should hold a final and CDs for example,

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:22.609
for me it was really an experience of realizing

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.879
that you can teach yourself a tremendous amount of skills

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.879
and especially technical skills and I as somebody who

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:32.789
originally was maybe afraid of things like coding,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.230
was able to just with persistence teach myself

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.600
something and I feel like that's something that can really

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.969
scale because if I can do it really anybody can.
